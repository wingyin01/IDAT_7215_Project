            stays:
            bolted and cup patches</heading><content>The surveyors should be specially careful to see that the end attachments of the
            screwed stays of all passenger steamships’ boilers are satisfactory and in good
            condition. They are cautioned that a number of cases have occurred in which many screwed
            steel stays in the water spaces of steel boilers have broken squarely across, in line
            with the water side of the outer plate, in the ordinary course of working. It is
            sometimes difficult to detect such defects, although they may be so serious as to render
            the boiler in which they occur quite unfit for the pressure which is required, and for
            which it would otherwise be sufficient. Great vigilance is therefore necessary in the
            examination of such stays, and the surveyors will find the frequent application of the
            hydraulic test a valuable aid to the discovery of broken ones. The surfaces supported by
            these stays should be carefully gauged before, during, and after the hydraulic test, as
            undue deflection will no doubt occur in the vicinity of any stays that may be
            broken.</content><content>Boilers which have patches that are only bolted, or fitted in a temporary manner,
            should not receive a declaration for twelve months. Such patches should be removed and
            be properly and permanently fitted at the earliest opportunity. Cup patches over the
            ends of stays should not be passed, and, if it comes to the knowledge of the surveyor
            that cup patches have been fitted over the ends of stays during the time a certificate
            is in force, he should take steps to have them removed and the defects made
            good.</content></section><section id="ID_1438403093103_003" name="s135" reason="inEffect" role="regulation" startPeriod="2021-04-22" status="operational" temporalId="s135"><num value="135">135.</num><heading>Repairs to boilers by welding</heading><proviso name="proviso" temporalId="s135_proviso">Provided the work is carried out by
            experienced workmen to the satisfaction of the surveyor, welding processes may be
            employed, within limits, for repairing cracks in furnaces, combustion chambers, and end
            plates of boilers, and in the same parts for re-enforcing the landing edges of leaky
            riveted seams which have become reduced by repeated chipping and caulking.</proviso><text>In some old furnaces which have been repaired by the above processes, it has been
            found that, after a few months working, cracks have again developed at parts adjacent to
            those welded, probably owing to the original material of the furnace having become
            fatigued and worn out by long and severe usage. In dealing with old furnaces, therefore,
            this fact should be taken into
            consideration.</text><text>The re-enforcing of the circumferential seams of boiler shells may be allowed if the
            end plates are well stayed, but no welding should be done to those parts by any process,
            such as the oxy-acetylene, oxy-hydrogen or other similar method, which may cause local
            heating over an appreciable area of the plate.</text><text>In no circumstances should any part of a boiler of a passenger vessel be welded if
            wholly in tension under working conditions, such as a stay, or the shell plate at a
            longitudinal seam, the failure of which by cracking at the welded part might lead to
            disastrous results.</text><text>In any case in which the proposed repairs to the boilers of passenger vessels by
            either of the above processes are of an uncommon or unusually extensive character, the

Water-tube boilers should be stamped on a conspicuous part of the steam drum near the water gauge. If, however, in single-ended or double-ended cylindrical boilers the casings for forced draught, or other fittings, would prevent them being readily seen when placed on the end plate, the marks may be stamped on the right-hand side of the shell plate, near the end plate and in such a position that they win not be hidden by the lagging.</content></section><section id="ID_1438403093150_002" name="s139" reason="inEffect" role="regulation" startPeriod="2021-04-22" status="operational" temporalId="s139"><num value="139">139.</num><heading>Fixing of working pressure and examination of plans</heading><content>The surveyor should fix the working pressure for boilers by a series of
            calculations of the strength of the various parts, taking into consideration the
            workmanship and material. The Government has arranged to receive, for examination by
            their surveyors, plans and particulars of boilers before the commencement of
            manufacture, by these means hoping to prevent questions arising after the boilers are
            finished and on board. This practice has been found to work well in saving the time of
            the surveyors, and in preventing expense, inconvenience, and delay to
            owners.</content><content>Plans of boilers may be received for examination upon payment of the fee prescribed
            in the Scale of Fees for Surveys and Inspections, etc., and the surveyor may proceed as
            far as witnessing the hydraulic test, and making the subsequent internal examination
            before any further instalment of the passenger certificate survey fee is paid. Engineers
            and boiler-makers should be advised of this arrangement.</content><content>When the surveyor has received plans of new boilers, or of alterations to boilers,
            and has approved of them, he should, of course, be careful, in making his examination
            from time to time, to see that the construction proceeds in accordance with the approved
            designs. When he has not had the plans submitted, but is called upon to survey a boiler,
            he should measure the parts, note the details of construction, and, if necessary, bore
            the plates to ascertain their thickness, etc., before he gives his declaration: and in
            the event of any novelty in construction, or of any departure from the practice of
            staying and strengthening noted in these regulations, he should report full particulars
            to the Principal Surveyor of Ships before fixing the working pressure.</content><content>The surveyor cannot declare a boiler to be safe unless he is fully informed as to
            its construction, material, and workmanship. He should, therefore, be very careful in
            giving a declaration for a boiler that he is not called upon to survey until after it is
            completed, and fixed in the ship.</content></section><section id="ID_1438403093165_001" name="s140" reason="inEffect" role="regulation" startPeriod="2021-04-22" status="operational" temporalId="s140"><num value="140">140.</num><heading>Increase of boiler pressure</heading><content>A pressure once allowed on the boiler of a passenger steamship should not in any circumstances be increased unless the surveyor has previously referred the matter to the Principal Surveyor of Ships.

            over-heating, unless careful precautions are taken while steam is being raised, the
            surveyor should in all cases endeavour to persuade makers and owners of such boilers to
            make the strength of the uptakes considerably in excess of that required for ordinary
            superheaters subject to external
            pressure.</content><content>The employment of Bowling rings is beneficial by adding to the strength as well as
            allowing for expansion, but if there is a difficulty in getting these fitted, hoops
            riveted to the uptake, although not so desirable as Bowling rings, may be employed to
            increase the resistance of the tubes against collapse. The use of Bowling rings with a
            moderate thickness of plate is better than the use of very thick plating.</content><content>The above applies to the uptakes of all boilers of this type, including ordinary

                        corrosion has, in a number of cases, been found on the outer surface of
                        copper steam pipes which have been covered with non-conducting material
                        composed chiefly of asbestos combined with a binding material, more
                        particularly where the pipes have been wetted by sea water. The surveyors
                        should therefore pay special attention to the examination and condition of
                        copper steam pipes which may be covered with asbestos and other porous
                        lagging, especially when the pipes are exposed to the action of sea water,
                        and where they find any evidence of the existence of corrosion, they should
                        take special steps to satisfy themselves that the pipes are of sufficient
                        thickness and otherwise safe for the pressure at which they are to be
                        worked. It is most desirable that copper pipes which would be liable to be
                        occasionally wetted by sea water should be efficiently protected by a
                        waterproof covering over the lagging, which should be free from acid and

            survey.</content><content>The responsibility of seeing to the efficiency of the manner in which the valves
            are fitted, so as to be out of the control of the engineer when steam is up, rests with
            the surveyor, who should see that the method adopted is efficient and one that is
            approved by the Principal Surveyor of Ships.</content><content>The safety-valves should be fitted with lifting-gear, so arranged that the two or
            more valves on any one boiler can at all times be eased together, without interfering
            with the valves on any other boiler. The lifting-gear should in all cases be so arranged
            that it can be worked by hand from some accessible place free from steam danger, and the
            arrangement should permit of the valves being turned round on their seats by
            hand.</content><content>Care should be taken that the safety-valves have a lift equal to one-fourth of
            their diameter; that the openings for the passage of steam to and from the valves,
            including the waste-steam pipe, have each an area not smaller than required by
                <ref>paragraph 230(c)</ref>, and the area of the main waste-steam pipe should not be
            smaller than the combined area of the branch pipes. Each valve box should have a drain
            pipe fitted at its lowest part, which shall be led to the bilge or to a tank clear of
            the boiler.</content><content>In the case of lever-valves, if the holes in the lever are not bushed with brass,
            the pins must be of brass; iron and iron working together must not be passed.</content><content>Too much care cannot be devoted to seeing that there is proper lift, also that free
            means of escape for the waste steam are provided, as it is obvious that, unless the
            means for escape of the waste steam are ample, the effect is the same as reducing the
            area of the valves or putting an extra load upon them.</content><content>The valve seats should be secured by studs and nuts. The valves should have a
            clearance in the seats of at least 1/32 inch on the diameter, and should not project
            below them.</content></section><section id="ID_1438403094335_002" name="s232" reason="inEffect" role="regulation" startPeriod="2021-04-22" status="operational" temporalId="s232"><num value="232">232.</num><heading>Spring-loaded safety-valves</heading><leadIn>The surveyor need raise no question as to the sufficiency of spring-loaded valves,

            used in the boilers. These regulations are chiefly directed to the prevention of fire,
            but immunity cannot be attained unless installations are used and maintained with care
            and unless the consequences of neglect are fully appreciated. Serious fires have
            generally originated from apparently insignificant causes, such as burning oil running
            out of the furnace fronts on to the tank top or an almost imperceptible spray of oil
            from a defective gland or joint, not perhaps readily noticeable but easily ignited. The
            conditions which are most dangerous, and which it is most important to avoid, are
            conditions which will allow a small fire to spread to waste oil that has been left to
            accumulate in the bilges or on the double-bottom tank tops, and so get rapidly out of
            control.</content><content>The rapidity with which fire can be communicated to oil, and the rapidity with
            which it will spread, depend to a great extent on the temperature of the oil relative to
            its flash-point. If the temperature of the oil in the bilges and on the tank top even
            approaches the flash-point, fire will spread with great rapidity, but if this
            temperature exceeds the flash-point, there will be added a constant risk of explosion.
            It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that surfaces upon which waste oil may
            possibly collect should be kept cool. The under sides of boilers should be well
            insulated, and the spaces below them should be efficiently ventilated so that the
            temperatures there may be kept as low as practicable, at least 30<sup>o</sup>F. below
            the flash-point of the oil.</content><content>The use of coal and oil alternatively, or together, especially the latter, is
            strongly deprecated, though not absolutely prohibited, but where such a course is
            proposed, the arrangements for carrying this out must be submitted to the Principal
            Surveyor of Ships for consideration.</content><content>Surveyors should point out that it is necessary to have a careful organization of
            the operations by those responsible for the safety of the ship.</content><content>The scrupulous observance of cleanliness is essential to safety, and the danger of
            fire can thereby be reduced to a minimum. Carelessness in allowing deposits of waste oil
            and coal dust, or defective and leaky joints and fittings will always be extremely
            dangerous.</content><content>Passenger vessels in which oil fuel is used should be visited whenever possible
            between surveys, and if the surveyor, as a result of his observations either at the time
            of survey or during the currency of the passenger certificate, is of opinion that there
            is not sufficient care in respect of cleanliness and maintenance, he should report the
            case to the Principal Surveyor of Ships for consideration, in order that it may be
            decided whether a declaration for the full period of twelve months can be issued or
            whether the current certificate should be withdrawn.</content><content>Woodwork should be rigorously excluded from boiler rooms and no combustible
            materials should be stored near any part of the oil fuel installation. Boiler room
            casings should be efficiently insulated by fire-resisting material, more particularly
            when there is any possibility of woodwork in the spaces surrounding the casings being
            affected by a fire in the boiler rooms.</content><content>Special attention should be given to the positions and condition of the fire
            appliances, including hoses, chemical extinguishers, and the means for closing the
            stokehold to exclude air. The froth extinguishers should be systematically tested, and
            so disposed as to be available in case of fire in any boiler compartment.</content><content>If any difficulty arises in securing the adoption of the arrangements indicated in
            these instructions, the matter should be referred for consideration by the Principal
            Surveyor of Ships.</content></section><section id="ID_1438403094585_004" name="s255" reason="inEffect" role="regulation" startPeriod="2021-04-22" status="operational" temporalId="s255"><num value="255">255.</num><heading>Flash-point</heading><content>The flash-point of the oil must not be less than 150<sup>o</sup>F.

        <text class="left_indent_0 align_justified">A flooding curve for a vessel floating at a given
            water line and with given permeability is one showing, for any point in the vessel’s
            length, the maximum length of compartment (having its centre of length at the point in
            question) which can be laid open to the sea without at any point immersing a margin line
            drawn three inches below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck, at
            side.<marker role="blank-line"></marker></text>
        <text class="left_indent_0 align_justified">The length of compartment defined above is the
            “floodable
            length”
            at the point and is expressed as a percentage of the vessel’s
            length.<marker role="blank-line"></marker></text>
        <text class="left_indent_0 align_justified">The size and shape of a flooding curve depend
            principally on the freeboard ratio
                (<i>see
                notes which follow</i>), and on the permeability of the flooded space
                (<i>see
                definition, par.
                6</i>); they depend, also, to a smaller extent, on the character
            of the lines of the vessel and on the sheer of the margin lines forward and aft
                (<i>see
                notes which follow</i>). Using the same vertical and horizontal scales for
            percentage of length, the ends of a flooding curve terminate on straight lines drawn
            through points in the base line representing the positions of the fore and after
            perpendiculars, at an angle
                <i>0</i>,
            where tan.
                <i>0</i>
            =
                <i>2</i>.
            These lines are called the forward and after terminals
            respectively.<marker role="blank-line"></marker></text>
        <text class="left_indent_0 align_justified"><ref>Paragraph 9</ref> requires that, in
            determining the floodable length, a uniform permeability shall be assumed throughout the
            machinery space, another for the fore and outside that space, and a third for the after
            end, all up to the margin line. It will be seen therefore that; for a given vessel,
            three flooding curves must in general be drawn more or less completely, corresponding to
            the three different permeabilities, the significant part of each depending on the
            positions of the machinery
            bulkheads.<marker role="blank-line"></marker></text>
        <text class="left_indent_0 align_justified">In order to determine curves of floodable length
            for any ship having prescribed permeability, block
            coefficient,
            freeboard ratio and sheer ratios, the Standard
            Diagrams
            should be used. These give floodable lengths (for the two permeabilities 60 per cent and
            100 per cent), for a definite standard family of ship forms of differing block
            coefficients, freeboard ratios and sheer ratios. The floodable lengths obtained are in
            every case to be set off at right angles to the base line of the floodable length curve.
            For the two permeabilities mentioned, the curves of floodable length for any vessel of
            the standard form can be obtained directly from the cross curves given in the Plates, by
            the method indicated on Plate
            II;
            whilst for any other permeability the appropriate curve may be obtained (including
            terminal points) as
            follows—<marker role="blank-line"></marker></text>

            floodable length

            at that point for a permeability μ will be given
