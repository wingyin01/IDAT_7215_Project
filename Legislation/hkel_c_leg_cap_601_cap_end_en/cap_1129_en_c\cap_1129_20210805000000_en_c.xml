            International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the Constitution of the
            International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. As from 1 July 1997,
            the full official name of the Hong Kong Red Cross shall be “The Red Cross of the Hong
            Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China”. The accepted
            short title shall be the “Hong Kong Red Cross (Branch of the Red Cross Society of
            China)”. The HKRC shall use the emblem of the RCSC. The National Headquarters in Beijing
            shall continue to represent the RCSC in international organizations or meetings where
            statutory participation is confined to National Societies. However, whenever
            appropriate, HKRC representatives would be invited to serve as members of the RCSC
            delegations.<marker role="blank-line"></marker><marker role="blank-line"></marker></text><text class="left_indent_0 first_line_indent_24">As a RCSC branch with a high degree of
            autonomy, the HKRC will have full autonomy, subject to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
            Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China and other laws enacted
            by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to formulate or revise
            its regulations and rules, and to make its own decisions on matters concerning its
            internal management, which include organizational structure, policies and administrative
            decision making, working procedures, personnel, financial management, nature and forms
            of service operations. The Red Cross Law of the People’s Republic of China and the RCSC
            Constitution shall not apply to Hong Kong or to the HKRC. The Hong Kong Red Cross
            (Branch of the Red Cross Society of China) shall be able to maintain and develop direct
            contact and operational programmes with other members of the International Red Cross and
            Red Crescent Movement, provided such contact and programmes do not contravene the
            Movement’s Fundamental Principle of “Unity” and that the RCSC National Headquarters be
            duly informed.<marker role="blank-line"></marker><marker role="blank-line"></marker></text><text class="first_line_indent_0">15 April 1997, Beijing</text><sourceNote>(<ref>Schedule
