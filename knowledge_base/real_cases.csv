Hon Zervos JA (giving the Reasons for Judgment of the Court):
Introduction
The applicant was jointly indicted with three other defendants on a sole count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely 1.87 kilogrammes of a crystalline solid containing 1.47 kilogrammes of methamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as “Ice”), contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134.  We will refer to the applicant by his trial designation as D1.  The other defendants were D2, D3 and D4.
On 12 December 2017, following a trial before Deputy Judge McMahon (“the judge”) and a jury, D1 and D2 were both convicted, whilst D4 was acquitted, of the count on the indictment.  The judge ruled at the close of the prosecution case that D3 had no case to answer, after which he was formally acquitted of the count.
On 13 December 2017, the judge sentenced D1 to 24 years’ imprisonment.
D1 applied for leave to appeal against his conviction, which was eventually heard by a Single Judge on 17 June 2020.  He refused to grant leave to D1 to appeal on the eight grounds of appeal against conviction put forward.  
On 24 June 2020, D1 filed an application to renew his application for leave to appeal (Form XIII).  
At the conclusion of the hearing of the renewal application, we refused D1 leave to renew his application and dismissed his appeal.  We also made a 6 weeks loss of time order against D1.  We said we would hand down the reasons for our decisions in due course.  These are our reasons.
The delay and disruption 
It is a matter of regret to this Court that these proceedings have been unnecessarily prolonged and wasteful due mainly to the involvement of D1’s fellow prisoner, Mr George Jutting, who apparently represents himself as a law graduate of the University of Cambridge and purports to offer legal assistance to other prisoners such as D1.  Given the large volume of appeals he has been involved in, he seems to be operating a legal practice out of prison, when he is neither qualified nor entitled to do so.  How he is permitted and able to do this is a matter that needs to be urgently addressed by the prison authorities.  
In this application, there have been numerous and ongoing procedural issues because of non-compliance with requirements, changes to the grounds of appeal, and requests for further time to obtain legal assistance.  Experience has shown that Mr Jutting invariably presents grounds of appeal and written submissions on behalf of fellow prisoners which are unnecessarily lengthy, repetitive and prolix, and clearly lack the professional skill and standing of a qualified and experienced legal practitioner.   These grounds and written submissions have usually involved Mr Jutting dissecting the minutiae of a trial in order to find points for argument on appeal, even if they were not in issue at trial.  The arguments in support of the points are generally couched in technical and pretentious language with purported references to legal principles that have either changed or developed over time.  There is also the added burden that the written submissions are not in strict compliance with appellate practice and procedure which unnecessarily engages the Court in further directions and exchanges.  He is able to do this by exploiting the Court’s accommodating and flexible approach when dealing with an applicant who is acting in person. 
Mr Jutting cleverly frames his grounds of appeal by appearing superficially arguable through the use of a convoluted language and numerous case citations, which are then drafted and redrafted in order to secure legal assistance, come what may.  In the present case, D1’s numerous applications for legal assistance have been rejected by the Department of Legal Aid, the Bar Free Legal Service Scheme and the Clinical Legal Education Programme of the University of Hong Kong.
This case has suffered inordinate delay because of the non-compliance with the Court’s directions and time requirements, the staggered requests by D1 for further information and materials, and the last minute filing of submissions.  It is the lack of proper consideration of a ground of appeal, with little or no assessment or discernment as to whether it has a reasonable prospect of success, that can severely undermine the criminal justice system because of the wasteful time and effort expended by those involved in the administration of justice in dealing with such a ground, when th"

J U D G M E N T
________________
On 10 October 2018, following his plea of guilty to a single count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely 973 grammes of a crystallised solid containing 965 grammes of methamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as Ice), contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134, the applicant was sentenced by Campbell-Moffat J (the judge) to 15 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.
On 3 January 2020, the applicant filed a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence out of time.  He stated in his application that he considered the sentence imposed on him to be excessive after comparing it with a similar case, which he identified as HKSAR v Chau Kai Kwok, HCCC 180/2019 [2020] HKCFI 112.  He also stated that the reason for the delay in filing his application was due to his difficulty in raising money in order to mount an appeal.  
The applicant appears in person, having had legal aid refused on 14 April and 21 August 2020 and 12 January 2021.
The facts agreed by the applicant and outlined to the judge are fairly straightforward.  Late in the evening on 13 October 2017, the applicant was intercepted at the border on his return to Hong Kong from mainland China.  He was searched and found wrapped around his waist were two plastic bags containing the drugs.  Upon his arrest and caution, he admitted that a person called “Ah Chik” had asked him to deliver the drugs across the border to Hong Kong for a reward of $9,000.  He agreed that he knowingly imported the drugs into Hong Kong and that the estimated value of the drugs at the time of the offence was $417,417.  
At the time of sentence, the applicant was 43 years of age.  He lived alone, although he had been previously married and had a son.  He occasionally worked running parallel goods.  He had six previous criminal convictions since 1992 and his last conviction was in 2012 when he was convicted for trafficking in a dangerous drug and sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment.  
The judge in her reasons for sentence did not find any meaningful mitigation advanced on the applicant’s behalf.  She applied the sentencing guidelines laid down in HKSAR v Abdallah Anwar Abbas [2009] 2 HKLRD 437 and adopted a starting point of 21 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.  She enhanced the notional starting point by 2 years for the international element to 23 years and 9 months’ imprisonment, which she reduced by one third for the applicant’s guilty plea to 15 years and 10 months’ imprisonment. 
It is noted that the enhancement the applicant received for the international element was in accordance with the authorities and that resultant sentence of 15 years and 10 months’ imprisonment was neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive.  
The case of Chau Kai Kwok that is mentioned by the applicant is entirely different from the facts of the present case.  The dangerous drug involved in that case was cocaine and the defendant was charged both with trafficking and manufacturing in a dangerous drug.  The quantities of drugs involved in that case were different from the amount in the present case and there was no international element.  The defendant received a sentence of 15 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.
The applicant’s explanation for the inordinate delay in filing his application is both inadequate and unacceptable.  In any event, it follows from what I have said that I find no merit in this application and I refuse the applicant an extension of time and leave to appeal against sentence out of time.
Having refused the application, I inform the applicant that he has the right to renew his application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, but he is also warned that one of the consequences of so doing may be that the Court of Appeal could make an order for the loss of any time which the applicant has spent in custody pending his appeal, if the Court came to the view that there was no justification for the renewal of the application.

I have decided to grant leave to appeal against sentence to the applicant on the papers.  I consider it reasonably arguable that a sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment on a plea of guilty for the type of burglary alleged in this case was manifestly excessive.
I am separately concerned whether the enhancement of 3 months’ imprisonment for the applicant’s status as a Form 8 Recognizance holder was justified.  The policy of enhancing a sentence for such defendants/applicants was first adopted in HKSAR v Sandagdorj Altankhuyag & Anor [2014] 1 HKC 206.  However, the Court there also said, at [22]:
“We do not say that someone sharing the 2nd appellant’s status would aggravate his position in every case or in every crime.  Obviously, there are crimes committed by refugees or torture claimants which do not affect the community at large or have any significant impact on Hong Kong’s reputation”.
It is arguable whether this crime is one meriting any such enhancement.
I would also bring to the parties’ attention the case of HKSAR v Chau Man Ying (Unrep., CACC 439/2011, 15 May 2012) for the light it may shed on the applicant’s criminality.  Although the buildings in question are different, one occupied, the other closed for redevelopment, the circumstances were that the applicant did not seek to go anywhere other than the roof, where he stole an item of minimal value.
I give leave to appeal on the papers and grant the applicant an appeal aid certificate.  I direct that the appeal to be listed within 3 months from the date of this judgment.

________________
On 2 November 2021, the applicant pleaded guilty to one charge of keeping a divan (Charge 1) and one charge of trafficking in dangerous drugs, namely 0.58 gramme of a crystalline solid containing 0.57 gramme of methamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as Ice) and 0.83 gramme of a mixture containing 0.70 gramme of heroin hydrochloride (Charge 2) before District Court Judge Tse Ching (the judge).  On 23 December 2021, the judge sentenced the applicant to 16 months’ imprisonment on Charge 1 and 30 months’ imprisonment on Charge 2, with 12 months of the sentence on Charge 1 to run consecutively to the sentence on Charge 2, resulting in a total sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment.
On 6 January 2022, the applicant applied for leave to appeal his sentence.
Ms Anna Ho, for the applicant, advances three grounds of appeal against sentence.  Ground 1 complains that the starting point adopted by the judge for Charge 2 was manifestly excessive.  Ground 2 avers that the judge erred in considering the role of the applicant in the two charges and adopting a consecutive element of 12 months, which resulted in a double penalty.  Ground 3 alleges the judge failed to apply the totality principle.
In the afternoon on 18 March 2021, police entered the flat occupied by the applicant, where they found items and paraphernalia for the consumption of drugs and 18 people sitting around two tables in one of the rooms of the flat.  The police also found 3 plastic bags, consisting of the drugs particularised in Charge 1 and 3 packets, consisting of the drugs particularised in Charge 2.  The police also found in the applicant’s possession 2 mobile telephones and $1,750 cash.  The applicant admitted under caution that the flat operated as a divan for the consumption of drugs by people and he was the keeper of it.  A packet of heroin would cost $280 and a packet of Ice would cost $140.  A handwritten price list was affixed next to the door of the divan.  Police also found a notebook in which the applicant would record drug transactions and $900 cash in a desk drawer, which the applicant acknowledged was the proceeds of drug transactions.  
At the time of the offence, the applicant was 57 and living off social welfare benefits.  He had numerous previous convictions for an array of offences, including six for drug offences, of which four were for trafficking.  He had been discharged from prison custody on 9 January 2021, having served a three-year sentence for burglary.
As for Ground 1, the judge adopted an overall notional starting point of 39 months for Charge 2.  She enhanced the sentence by 6 months to 45 months for the aggravating factors that more than one drug was involved and that this was the applicant’s fifth conviction for trafficking.  She arrived at a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment after giving the applicant a reduction of one third for his guilty plea.  
Ms Ho complains that the judge did not take into account that the quantity of drugs involved was relatively small, 1.27 grammes, and that the previous drug offence took place in 2007 and the last trafficking offence in 2000.  The applicant had convictions for one possession offence and three trafficking offences between 1982 and 1988, one trafficking offence in 2000 and one possession offence in 2007.  Whilst it is accepted that the previous trafficking convictions took place some time ago, the fact is that the applicant had four previous convictions for trafficking, which the judge was entitled to take into account, bearing in mind when they occurred.  I think the judge did bear this in mind because the enhancement for this factor and that there was more than one drug involved was 6 months.
According to the sentencing guidelines and the sentencing approach in respect of more than one drug, the starting point of 39 months’ imprisonment was within the appropriate range of penalty.  See HKSAR v Tam Yi-chun (No 2) [2014] 3 HKLRD 691; R v Lau Tak-ming and Ors [1990] 2 HKLR 370; HKSAR v Islam SM Majharul [2020] 3 HKLRD 146..  It was also appropriate for the judge to enhance the sentence by 6 months because of the aggravating factors identified.  
This ground is not reasonably arguable.
As for Ground 2, Ms Ho complains that the judge reflected the applicant’s role in the sentences of both charges, and by ordering a consecutive element of 12 months thereby imposed a double penalty.  She submits that the judge took into account under Charge 1 that the applicant’s role was supplying drugs to others, and under Charge 2 she enhanced the applicant’s sentence b"

判案理由書日期：	2025年9月10日
判案理由書
申請人被控一項‘串謀販運危險藥物’罪。他否認控罪，經高等法院游德康法官（原審法官）會同陪審團審訊後於2024年12月17日被陪審團以6:1裁定罪名成立，同日被判處13年監禁。
申請人不服，就定罪及判刑提出上訴許可申請。
控方案情
罪行詳情指「廖光榮於或約於2018年3月19日在香港及其他地方，與黃榮滿（PW1）、潘鑑祥及馬仕強一同串謀非法販運危險藥物，即內含193克海洛英鹽酸鹽的232克固體」。
申請人及控罪內列出的同謀於3月19日1639時一同從香港坐船前往澳門，同日2315時從澳門回到香港。4人乘的士離開中港碼頭前往翠田街，到達後落車時隨即被在場的警員截停及控制。
PW1及潘鑑祥後來被送往威爾斯親王醫院。PW1於3月20日0700時從體內排出一條綠色包裝物體。潘鑑祥於同日0455時及0503時先後排出兩條條狀物。兩人排出的物體後由政府化驗師確認裝載著罪行詳情中的危險藥物。有關毒品2018年3月市值約為港幣$169,360。
PW1及潘鑑祥於2018 年3 月21 日各被控一項「販運危險藥物罪」，他們承認控罪，在2019 年6 月18 日分別被判處6 年2 個月及7 年2 個月監禁。申請人和餘下的同謀馬仕強沒有同時被控「販運危險藥物罪」。
PW1於2019年6月10及15日分別先後錄取兩份「不損權益供詞」指證申請人。警方在2021年7月22日再次拘捕申請人，最終於2021年12月20日以本案罪行起訴申請人。
PW1在本案以控方證人身分出庭作供，指在案發日他是有毒癮人士，透過馬仕強得知申請人希望PW1透過他哥哥在葡京有股份這關係在澳門葡京免費「攞房」，於是4人一起坐船去澳門。證人拿到房間後與其他3人會合一起進入房間。
房間內，申請人給PW1試用一些毒品，然後叫PW1「幫手拖嘢返去」，承諾到香港後給證人兩安士白粉為報酬。申請人知道證人可以「入櫃」，說那些白粉有錢都買不到。PW1有毒癮，貪心，所以應承了申請人。
申請人及潘鑑祥在房間內用保鮮紙將白粉捲起來以容易塞入肛門。PW1曾經聽到申請人說他自己會「入兩條」，馬仕強就會「入1條」。PW1最終塞了一條入自己肛門，但是沒有親眼目睹其他5條毒品去向。
入好毒品後4人一同離開葡京，坐的士到碼頭乘船回香港。PW1說當日去澳門及回香港的船票都是申請人出錢買的，來回共8張。
4人在晚上11時許到達香港後一起上的士，由申請人對司機說去大圍。PW1忘記申請人說了甚麼地址，應該是申請人家附近。PW1庭上說他同申請人一起坐的士去大圍是因為PW1肛門「有條嘢」，要給回申請人才拿到兩安士白粉的報酬。
到達大圍地址停車後，申請人給車錢，而與此同時的士車門已經被警察拉開，4人隨即被拘捕。
一如以上提及，PW1後來在警員在場下在醫院將葡京房間內塞入自己肛門的毒品排出了體外，被警察檢取為證物。
辯方說法
申請人選擇不作供，亦沒有傳召任何辯方證人。
辯方律師在結案陳詞指出，若沒有PW1的供詞，控方便沒有任何證據證明申請人干犯本案罪行。辯方指PW1的證供前言 不對後語，包括是次販毒的報酬、在酒店房裏有否試毒、誰捲毒品、捲了多少條毒品、誰在房間裏沖涼這些事項上，PW1庭上證供與其錄影會面及兩份無損權益供詞之間出現分歧。
輕判請求
求情時，申請人62歲，獨居。申請人在2021年7月22日第二次被拘捕時候已經沒有工作數個月，期間依賴每月$3,700的公共援助。
申請人有12項定罪紀錄，當中包括2項販運危險藥物罪（分別在2005年及2010年判監56及44個月）；5項管有危險藥物罪。申請人在2021年7月22日因本案再次被拘捕，獲警方保釋等候調查。然而申請人在2021年12月20 日被起訴當日開始棄保潛逃，直至2022年10月14日緝捕歸案，期後一直被還押。
判刑理由
原審法官考慮到本案罪行牽涉毒品為PW1及潘鑑祥個別販運毒品份量的總和，即193克。根據案例R v Lau Tak-ming and others [1990] 2 HKLR 370，販運193克海洛英鹽酸鹽的量刑起點為8至12年間。
原審法官考慮到本案涉及跨境販運元素。
原審法官考慮到申請人在本案串謀中扮演比較重要的主導角色，包括聯絡PW1去澳門葡京酒店「攞房」；負責買船票；給PW1試用毒品；承諾給予他「拖嘢」酬勞；捲毒品讓PW1及潘鑑祥「入櫃」；及負責給錢坐的士前往大圍申請人住所附近。
以申請人的相對主導及重要角色而言，原審法官認為量刑起點應較一個普通送貨人為高。若以193克海洛英鹽酸鹽計算，普通送貨人的量刑起點應為11年10個月。基於申請人角色及串謀販運牽涉跨境元素，原審法官分別將起點提高3及9個月，共12個月。提升後的刑期為12年10個月。
由於申請人是慣犯，這是他第3次干犯與販運毒品有關的事項，必須予以阻嚇性刑罰，因此原審法官加刑3個月至13年1個月。
原審法官認為，在審訊過程中透過申請人的大律師與控方及法庭充分合作，減省法庭時間、資源，減刑1個月予以肯定。除此以外，原審法官認為沒有任何其他減刑因素。
原審法官指出，申請人審訊後被定罪，沒有任何認罪扣減，最後刑期為13年監禁。原審法官確認在所有環境因素下，這是一個對申請人而言公平及合適的刑期。
是次申請
就定罪方面，申請人的定罪上訴理據為「證人作供有問題」。他特別指出，就PW1可得多少報酬一事，PW1前言不對後語，絕不可信。
就判刑方面，申請人指出他逾期上訴判刑的理由是「法援不獲批准，上訴減刑。」；上訴判刑理由則為「刑罰過重」。
答辯人回應
(定罪)
就申請人所指PW1的證供有問題方面，答辯人認為原審法官已在總結案情時開宗明義地向陪審團指出控方是完全依賴PW1的證供去證明申請人是否有參與販毒協議。原審法官明確地向陪審團指出他們必須肯定PW1是誠實可靠的證人才可倚賴他的證供，否則便必須裁定申請人罪名不成立。
原審法官已充足地引導陪審團應如何考慮證人證供，及如何處理證人證供出現不一致的地方。原審法官亦詳盡有序地向陪審團總結了文件證供及證人證供，亦有仔細地向陪審團複述控辯雙方結案陳詞要點。
答辯人認為原審法官已經非常妥善且公平地向陪審團作出案情總結及相關指引。
(判刑)
答辯人認為原審法官在判刑階段已跟隨上訴法庭在HKSAR v Herry Jane Yusuph [2021] 1 HKLRD 290 案提出判刑的六個步驟方法。申請人的刑期並非明顯過重。
分析討論
無論就定罪或判刑，我都完全同意答辯方的陳詞。尤其當指出，PW1在之前表示可得報酬1000元，在庭上則大幅提高至2安士毒品（即差不多與控罪所指的毒品等量），原審法官在導詞中有提及，所以陪審團是清楚的，卻仍然信納PW1的證供。
結論
我拒絕申請人的定罪及判刑逾期上訴許可申請。
警告
在庭上，我已就《刑事訴訟程序條例》第83W條，即有關‘減時’命令的風險，警告過申請人，他表示明白。

Date of Decision: 23 February 2022
Hon Macrae VP (giving the Decision of the Court):
On 4 November 2021, we handed down our Judgment and the reasons therefor in respect of the appeals against conviction and sentence of Chow Heung Wing, Stephen (“D1”) and Chan Kwun Chung (“D2”).  In so doing, we refused D1 and D2’s applications for leave to appeal against conviction and dismissed their appeals, but granted leave to appeal against sentence and allowed their appeals to the extent of reducing their respective sentences from 12 years’ to 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 years’ to 8 ‍years’ imprisonment.  D1 alone now applies to certify five points of law of great and general importance, which are said to be involved in our decision, pursuant to section 32(2) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, Cap 484.
The five points of law, as set out in D1’s Notice of Motion dated 9 November 2021, are as follows:
“1.	In cases of Gross Negligence Manslaughter (in which a convicted defendant could face life imprisonment) is it necessary to establish that an individual defendant assumed personal responsibility for the actions by third parties employed by a company controlled by him that were the substantial cause of death or is the relevant breach of duty to be assessed only by reference to whether the individual was in effective control, or a “hands-on” boss of the company?
2	In cases in which a co-defendant cross-examines another defendant by putting a bare assertion which completely undermines the latter’s defence, which is denied and in respect of which the co-defendant chooses not to testify and there is no other evidence capable of supporting such assertion - au contraire the evidence overwhelmingly suggests otherwise:
a.	Should the Trial Judge permit the prosecution to pursue the same assertion in cross-examination and later in closing as part of the prosecution case?
b.	Should the Trial Judge direct the jury in terms to ignore that assertion in the case of the Defendant against whom it was made?
3.	In Gross Negligence Manslaughter, where a breach of a personal duty of care is established, must the jury be directed to discount what the defendant should have known but for his breach of duty, in assessing whether the defendant objectively foresaw serious and obvious risk of death?
4.	In relation to the element of “truly exceptionally bad” conduct is such conduct limited to the circumstances of the proven breach or can other unrelated misconduct also be taken into account?
5.	Where a defendant is unaware of a serious and obvious risk of death, [in this case because D1 honestly believed that proper screening and bacterial testing was being performed] is his subjective belief relevant to any of the ingredients of Gross Negligence Manslaughter?  How should a trial judge direct the jury?” (original square brackets)
We have received full written submissions from Mr ‍Graham ‍Harris SC, with him Ms Yasmin Zahir, for D1; and from Raymond Leung SC, with him Ms Margaret Lau and Mr Eric Tsoi, for the respondent.  Both sets of counsel were involved for the same parties at the appeal before this Court.  Neither party objects to this matter being addressed on the papers without the need for an oral hearing.
The written Judgment of this Court on the appeal was very lengthy.  We shall try to avoid engaging in a second Judgment on the merits of what appear to us to be the same arguments which were mounted at the appeal.
In our view, the 1st point of law simply does not arise on the facts of the case.  Having summarised the voluminous evidence generated by an 8-month trial, which we made clear was limited to that necessary to deal with the arguments before us but did not mean there was ‍no other relevant evidence, we described Mr Harris’s “assumption of responsibility” argument as a “red herring”, which had not in any event been run at trial.  Rather, this was a case to which the established principles founded upon Donoghue v Stevenson applied.  Whilst not wishing to engage in further argument on the point, we observe that the principle was succinctly explained by Hobhouse LJ (as Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough then was) in Perrett v Collins & Ors, which is relied upon by Mr Leung, but which was not cited to us at the appeal:
“Where the plaintiff belongs to a class which either is or ought to be within the contemplation of the defendant and the defendant by reason of his involvement in an activity which gives him a measure of control over and responsibility for a situation which, if dangerous, will be liable to injure the plaintiff, the defendant is liable if as a result of his unreasonable lack of care "

Introduction
The applicant was charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug, , namely 700 millilitres of a liquid containing 455  grammes of cocaine, contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134.  He pleaded guilty to the charge in the Magistrate’s Court and was committed for sentence in the Court of First Instance.  
On 14 September 2016, the applicant appeared before Wong J (the judge), who sentenced him to 11 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.
On 13 January 2020, 3 years and 4 months after he was sentenced, the applicant filed a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence out of time.  He claims the delay in filing his application was because he was looking for grounds of appeal.  He said he recently found a case which was similar to his in which the defendant received a term of imprisonment of 10 years.
The brief facts
The facts outlined to the judge and admitted by the applicant when he pleaded guilty were as follows.  On 24 February 2016, the applicant, a Peruvian national, arrived in Hong Kong from Amsterdam, although his journey originated in Lima, Peru.  He was detained on arrival as it was suspected he had items concealed in his body.  He was taken to the North Lantau District Hospital where it was confirmed that he had foreign objects in his body cavity.  He was transferred to the Queen Mary Hospital and subsequently discharged 52 packets which were later confirmed to contain the dangerous drug particularized in the charge.  The estimated retail value of the cocaine at the time of the offence was $488,215.  
In a subsequent record of interview, the applicant admitted that a friend, by the name of Luis, had asked him to take the drugs to Hong Kong, for which he would be paid US$4,000 if successfully delivered.  He said that three females had invited him to their home where he swallowed the packets of drugs, which he was aware contained cocaine in liquid form.  He was instructed that he was to indicate his successful arrival in Hong Kong via WhatsApp, after which he would be contacted.  
The mitigation
In mitigation, it was submitted that the applicant was 22 years of age at the time of the offence.  It was said that his mother had passed away when he was 18 years of age and his father at the time disappeared.  He had undertaken study at university in the field of engineering and supported himself and his younger brother, who was attending school, with a part-time job.  It was also said that the applicant encountered financial difficulties and borrowed money, which he was unable to repay.  He was then approached by two women who told him that he would receive US$4,000 if he took illegal items into Hong Kong.  He agreed to swallow the drugs and bring them to Hong Kong.  It was claimed that when he arrived in Hong Kong, he called a man in Peru, indicating that he wished to withdraw but the man pressured him into continuing with the delivery.  
It was finally submitted that the applicant was remorseful and that he had participated in Father John Wotherspoon’s anti-drug campaign.  To this end, he had provided information to his family and brother so that they would convey his message through social media.  
The sentence
In sentencing the applicant, the judge applied the sentencing guidelines laid out in R v Lau Tak Ming [1992] HKLR 370 and AG v Pedro Nel Rojas [1994] 2 HKCLR 69, and adopted a starting point of 16 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, which he enhanced by 12 months for the international element.  The judge reduced the notional starting point of 17 years and 6 months’ imprisonment by one third for the applicant’s guilty plea to 11 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  
The judge followed the guidance in HKSAR v Akinyi Grace Sylvia, unrep., CACC 324/2015, 5 May 2016 and decided that the issue of any reduction to the applicant’s sentence for his participation in Father Wotherspoon’s campaign was a matter that should be raised with the Executive at an appropriate time.  That was then, as is now, an option available to a sentencing court to take in addressing a defendant’s participation in Father Wotherspoon’s anti-drug campaign.
The application for extension of time
The application is significantly out of time.  No valid grounds have been provided to justify the inordinate delay.  This Court can extend time in appropriate circumstances as explained in R v Wong Kai Kong and Another [1991] HKC 279.  Factors that are usually taken into account include, the length of the delay; the reasons for the delay; the bona fides of the application"

On 21 October 2017, the applicant was stopped by police officers who found in her handbag four transparent resealable plastic bags containing 19.3 grammes of a crystalline solid containing 19.08 grammes of methamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as Ice), one transparent resealable plastic bag containing 0.95 gramme of a solid containing 0.69 gramme of cocaine, and two transparent resealable plastic bags containing a total of 37 unused transparent resealable plastic bags.  
The applicant was arrested for trafficking in dangerous drugs and upon being cautioned she exercised her right of silence.  She was charged with trafficking in dangerous drugs and brought before the Magistrate’s Court.  During the course of her committal proceedings, she indicated that she would plead not guilty to the charge.  She was thereupon committed for trial in the Court of First Instance on 28 May 2018.  
The applicant’s case was fixed for trial in the Court of First Instance on 5 December 2018, with 7 days set aside, and for a case management hearing on 10 September 2018.  It was not until the case management hearing that the applicant admitted the offence of possession of dangerous drugs, as an alternative to the charge of trafficking in dangerous drugs.
The applicant went to trial and was acquitted of the offence of trafficking in dangerous drugs but convicted of the offence of possession of dangerous drugs.
In sentencing the applicant, the judge, as required by law, requested a Drug Addiction Treatment Centre report, which recommended that she was not suitable for this sentencing option.  She had previously been ordered to attend a Drug Addiction Treatment Centre.
In accordance with the sentencing guidelines and principles, the judge passed a custodial sentence on the applicant.  See HKSAR v Wong Wai Wah, CACC 181/2017, 12 October 2018, unreported; HKSAR v Mok Cho Tik [2001] 1 HKC 261.  She adopted a starting point of 18 months’ imprisonment which she enhanced by 12 months for the latent risk factor and 6 months for the fact that she was on bail when she committed the offence.  She reduced the starting point of 36 months’ imprisonment by 22.5% for the late indication that she was guilty of possession of dangerous drugs, which resulted in a sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment.
The applicant applies for leave to appeal against her sentence.  She complains that the sentence was too severe and too high.  She specifically takes issue with the following matters.  First, she complains that the reduction for her guilty plea of 22.5%, which she incorrectly describes as a one fourth reduction, was too low.  She claims that because of her limited legal knowledge she did not appreciate that she could indicate a plea of guilty to possession of dangerous drugs.  I note that the applicant, who is 31 years of age, has a long list of prior convictions for drug related offences and would be very familiar with the criminal justice system.  In any event, the judge committed no error in the reduction she gave the applicant for her late plea of guilty to the possession of dangerous drugs.  See HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2016] 5 HKLRD 1.  Secondly, she complains that the enhancement to her sentence of 6 months for committing the present offence whilst on bail was too severe.  The enhancement and the amount were in accordance with sentencing principles and completely justified in circumstances of the case.  See HKSAR v Leung Ting Fung & Anor [2015] 1 HKC 290.
It is noted that the judge also enhanced the applicant’s sentence for the latent risk factor by 12 months.  She did so on the basis that she determined that there was a real risk of dissemination of the drugs and that the risk was high.  The enhancement was therefore appropriate and justified.  The applicant takes no issue in relation to this aspect of her sentence. 
The matters raised by the applicant are without merit and her application for leave to appeal against sentence is refused. 
The applicant is reminded of her right to renew her application for leave to the Court of Appeal, but she is also warned of the consequences of doing so, which may include a direction for any loss of time spent in custody pending her appeal, if the Court were to come to the view that there was no justification for the renewal of her application.

Introduction
The applicant (D1) and his co-defendant (D2) were jointly charged with the following four offences, which all took place on 1 June 2018, at the residence where they both lived: 
(i) 	trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely 2,910 millimetres of a liquid containing 3.26 kilogrammes of gamma butyrolactone (commonly known as GBL), contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134, (the DDO) (Charge 1); 
(ii) 	possession of dangerous drugs, namely 34 millilitres of a liquid containing 36.6 grammes of GBL and 34 millilitres of a liquid, weighing 0.08 gramme upon drying, containing methamphetamine (commonly known as Ice), contrary to section 8(1)(a) and (2) of the DDO (Charge 2); 
(iii) 	possession of apparatus fit and intended for the inhalation or injection of a dangerous drugs, , namely one inhaling device, 7 tubes, 2 droppers, 3 straws and 2 syringes fit and intended for the inhalation of a dangerous drug, namely methamphetamine, contrary to section 36(1) and (2) of the DDO (Charge 3); and 
(iv) 	possession of a Part I poison, namely 20 tablets containing sildenafil, otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, Cap 138 (the PPO), contrary to sections 23(1), 33(1) and 34 of the PPO (Charge 4).  
D1 and D2 stood trial before District Court Judge Lin (the Judge).  D1 pleaded not guilty to Charges 1 to 3, but guilty to Charge 4, while D2 pleaded not guilty to all four charges.  On 29 November 2019, at the conclusion of the trial, the Judge found D1 guilty of Charges 1 to 3, and D2 not guilty of Charges 2 to 4, having dismissed Charge 1 against D2 after the prosecution conceded in its closing address there was insufficient evidence against him.  On 19 December 2019, the Judge sentenced D1 to a total of 3 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.  
On 14 January 2020, D1 filed an application for leave to appeal against sentence.  However, in the accompanying written submission from D1 dated 7 January 2020, he stated that he applying for leave to appeal against his conviction on Charges 1 and 2.  He further stated he was innocent of these offences, claiming, as he did at trial, that he believed the dangerous drug in question to be a cleaning agent which he was entitled to purchase from an overseas website for delivery to him in Hong Kong.
On 20 March 2020, D1 filed an application for leave to appeal against conviction out of time.  In the accompanying affirmation dated 19 March 2020, he stated that he was not satisfied with his conviction for Charges 1 and 2 and relied on his earlier submission that accompanied his application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
It would appear that in his original notice for leave to appeal, D1 conveyed the clear intention that he was applying for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence, even though he did not tick the box for conviction.  Accordingly, I treated this leave application as having been made within the prescribed period in respect of both conviction and sentence.
D1 applied for legal aid but it was refused on 15 June 2020.  He then sought assistance from the Clinical Legal Education Office at Hong Kong University.  On 31 August 2020, Mr Eric TM Cheung submitted a written submission on D1’s behalf, expressing concern over the Judge’s dealing with the concept of “possession” in respect of Charges 2 and 3 and the enhancement to the sentence on account of the international element. 
The facts
Most of the facts of the case were not in dispute and adduced into evidence by agreement of the parties.  On 31 May 2018, Customs officers intercepted a parcel from Lithuania addressed to D1.  Upon inspection, they found it contained three bottles of liquid with a total volume of 2,910 millilitres containing 3.26 kilogrammes of GBL.  In the morning of the next day, Customs officers, posing as postal workers, delivered the parcel to a flat in Sham Shui Po.  D1 acknowledged that the parcel was addressed to him and accepted receipt of it.  He was arrested and upon being cautioned admitted that he had ordered the substance in the parcel online.  He said he intended to use the substance as a cleaning agent for his car.  In support of his claim, he provided the website of an online shop from which he purchased the substance.

He denied saying that Fiaz gave him the drugs to sell to others.  It was Fiaz who was in possession of the cocaine who dropped the packet.  He believed that Fiaz was a police informant and the police had falsely implicated him in an effort to protect Fiaz.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
_______________________________
Introduction
The applicant was convicted after trial of one charge of trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely, 9.84 grammes of a solid containing 2.90 grammes of cocaine, contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance Cap 134, by District Judge Dufton (“the judge”) and was sentenced to 3 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.  He now applies in person for leave to appeal against his conviction.
Prosecution case
On 4 October 2017, PW1 (PC 19566) and PW2 (PC 21352), were patrolling in uniform along Middle Road.  The applicant was seen with another male Mohammad Mohsan Fiaz (“Fiaz”) leaning against a concrete barrier on the opposite side of the road.  Both of them walked in different directions upon seeing the police officers.
PW1 and PW2 approached the applicant and Fiaz.  PW1 testified that when he was about 2 meters from the applicant, the applicant took out a red and white Marlboro cigarette packet from his right trouser pocket with his right hand and dropped it on the ground. PW1 took the applicant back to the spot and retrieved the cigarette packet.  Twenty re-sealable plastic bags were found inside the cigarette packet containing a total of 9.84 grammes of a solid with 2.90 grammes of cocaine.  PW1 described the lighting as sufficient and that he had an unobstructed view.  The applicant pointed at Fiaz and said in English “he gave me this to selling to other people”.  It was put to PW1 that the applicant had said words to the effect that the drugs belonged to Fiaz.  PW1 disagreed.  The alleged admission was not relied on by the judge on the basis that no post-record was made and no caution was administered.
PW1 handed the applicant over to his plain clothed colleague and the applicant said in English “it’s not me.  It’s him, it’s him”.  It was an admitted fact that Fiaz was also arrested for possession of the cannabis found in his trouser waistband, and that Fiaz had pleaded guilty to the offence and was fined $2,500 in Kowloon City Magistrates Court.
PW2’s evidence was found to have been largely consistent with PW1’s but he was not able to recall whether the applicant had said anything when apprehended.
The applicant’s denial of ownership or possession of the cigarette packet and his claim that the cigarette packet was picked up 10 steps away from his left side was admitted into evidence by way of admitted facts with no challenge to its voluntariness or accuracy.  The judge attached no weight to such denials.
The prosecution case was given the Form 8 holder status of the applicant and the street value of the drugs at $12,900 the only inference to be drawn was that the applicant possessed the cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.
Defence case
The applicant did not give evidence.  His case was that he did not possess the cigarette packet or the drugs contained inside.  He denied saying that Fiaz gave him the drugs to sell to others.  It was Fiaz who was in possession of the cocaine who dropped the packet.  He believed that Fiaz was a police informant and the police had falsely implicated him in an effort to protect Fiaz.
Public Interest Immunity (PII) claim
An application for disclosure of whether or not Fiaz was a police informant was made.  The applicant was granted police bail after his arrest and was released from bail on 14 November 2018.  He was re-arrested on 29 January 2019 and charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug.  Fiaz was re-arrested on 9 February 2019 and was only prosecuted for possession of cannabis.
The prosecution opposed the application on the basis that the interception was made when the police carried out a routine patrol rather than acting on information.  The delay in prosecution of 15 months was found by the judge to be occasioned by the obtaining of DNA samples from the defendant and Fiaz for DNA analysis.  The application for disclosure was refused.
The Applicant’s position
The applicant has filed homemade grounds of appeal dated 24 May 2021, which can be summarized as follows:
Lack of incriminating DNA, fingerprint and CCTV evidence against him;
He did not make the alleged admission at the scene on interception;
He was not in possession of the drugs and did not throw them onto the ground as PW1 alleged;
The investigation report by PW3 and PW4 were incomplete; they were in same team as PW1 and PW2 and were assisting them to hide the true facts;
Fiaz was found in possession of cannabis so it was more likely that the drugs belonged to him;
He was a drug "

________________
Hon Zervos JA (giving the Judgment of the Court):
The appellant faced an indictment in which he was jointly charged with Chan Ying Hong (Chan) on two counts of trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely 499 grammes of a solid containing 381 grammes of ketamine (Count 1), and 1.719 kilogrammes of a solid containing 1.493 kilogrammes of ketamine (Count 3), contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134 (the Ordinance), and separately on one count of possession of a dangerous drug, namely 0.26 gramme of a solid containing 0.23 gramme of ketamine, contrary to section 8(1)(a) and (2) of the Ordinance (Count 2).  The appellant pleaded guilty to Count 2 and proceeded to trial on Counts 1 and 3 before Campbell-Moffat J (the judge) and a jury.  On 30 December 2021, the appellant was convicted of both counts by unanimous verdicts of the jury and sentenced to 17 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.
The appellant sought to appeal against his conviction only.  At the leave hearing on 15 December 2022, at which he was legally represented, the Single Judge noted that his sole ground of appeal comprised two matters.  The first matter constituted a pure question of law and did not require leave to appeal, namely whether the judge’s directions on drawing inferences unlawfully placed an onus of proof on the appellant to establish his innocence in the offences.  The second matter involved a question of fact, namely whether the judge’s direction on inferences was unnecessary, for which leave to appeal was refused.
On 21 December 2022, the appellant sought to renew his application for leave to appeal against conviction in respect of the second matter.  However, by a letter dated 4 February 2023, the appellant indicated his intention to abandon his renewed application.  He was directed to file a notice of abandonment but he did not do so.  At the appeal hearing, the appellant confirmed the abandonment of his renewal application and his appeal against conviction in respect of the second matter was dismissed.  The appeal proceeded to deal with the question of law with Mr David Boyton representing the appellant.
The prosecution case
It was alleged that on 3 October 2019, the appellant and Chan trafficked in the quantity of drugs set out in Counts 1 and 3.  Chan pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution at the appellant’s trial.  He was PW1 at trial.
Chan testified essentially that he had dealt with the dangerous ‍drugs on the instructions of the appellant.  In the morning of 2 October 2019, as instructed by the appellant, he had collected a carton ‍box containing about 3 kilogrammes of ketamine (which was further concealed in milk powder boxes) from a GoGoVan, checked into a room at Winland 800 Hotel (Winland Hotel) at Tsing Yi at noon, and gone to the appellant’s home in Tin Shui ‍Wai at about 9 pm, where he spent the night.  The appellant gave Chan $1,000 in order to settle the charges for the delivery and the hotel room.  On 3 October 2019, they each took some equipment from the appellant’s home to Winland Hotel, which included electronic scales, a sealing machine, plastic bags, empty pet food foil bags and a rice cooker, for the purpose of dealing with the dangerous drugs.  When they were unable to extend their stay at Winland Hotel, since there was no available room, they moved to the nearby Rambler Garden Hotel (Rambler Hotel), which the appellant managed to book for 3 days using his own credit card but Chan’s name and Identity Card number.  They checked into Room 2355.  Having done so, they went out from the room on several occasions in order to buy food and some further equipment, such as Ziploc bags, paper plates and gloves.  They then extracted the drugs from three of the six milk power boxes, divided them into smaller quantities, weighed the drugs, and placed them in Ziploc bags, marking their respective weights.  The appellant took photographs of the Ziploc bags and sent the photographs to another person to check if the packaging had been done correctly.  The Ziploc bags were further concealed within pet food foil bags and sealed.
There were two sets of admitted facts, in which the following facts and circumstances were admitted, namely:
The movements of the appellant and Chan inside Rambler Hotel, including their checking in and the four occasions they went in and out of the hotel together on 3 October 2019;
The arrests of the appellant and Chan and the seizure of the drugs.  At about 8:23 pm, the two men were both arrested at Rambler ‍Plaza, Tsing Yi.  At that time, Ch"

Before: Hon Macrae VP in Court
Date of Hearing: 19 July 2023
Date of Judgment: 19 July 2023
The applicant was sentenced to 6 years and 4 months’ imprisonment by Campbell-Moffat J (“the judge”) on 5 January 2023, following his plea of guilty in a magistrate’s court and his subsequent confirmation of that plea before the judge, to a single count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely, 35.53 grammes of a crystalline solid containing 34.51 grammes of methamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as ‘Ice’), contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134.
The applicant now applies for leave to appeal against sentence on the sole ground that the enhancement of 1 year for the aggravating feature of the applicant’s criminal record was manifestly excessive.
The facts
The applicant was found with the subject-matter of the count contained in six packets on his person when intercepted by police officers, whilst walking along Nam Cheong Street in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon at about 3 am on 1 January 2021.  At the time, he also had with him three mobile telephones and HK$10,606 in cash.  Following his arrest and caution, the applicant responded that he had nothing to say.  In a later video-recorded interview, the applicant declined to answer any questions put to him.
The estimated street value of the ‘Ice’ at the time was HK$20,891.64.  At his plea, the applicant admitted that he was unlawfully trafficking in the said ‘Ice’ at the time.
The applicant had 15 previous court appearances, 12 of which were concerned with dangerous drugs.  Although most of these 12 ‍appearances involved offences of possession of dangerous drugs or apparatus, there were three prior convictions for trafficking in dangerous drugs, for which he had received 18 months’ imprisonment in the District ‍Court in November 2005; 7 months’ imprisonment in Kowloon ‍City magistrate’s court in March 2009; and 11 years’ imprisonment following his successful appeal from the High Court in June ‍2010.  He had been discharged from prison in respect of his last conviction for possession of dangerous drugs on 13 November 2019.  The present offence of trafficking in dangerous drugs was committed on 1 ‍January 2021.
Mitigation
It was submitted in mitigation that in 1989, the applicant had committed his first offence of keeping a vice establishment, for which he was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment.  His wife had subsequently left him taking their two children, after which he had lost contact with them.  This led to a spiral of depression and involvement with dangerous drugs.  However, following his last release from custody, the applicant had found a job, which he had then lost when he committed the present offence.
It was said that the applicant was remorseful and was determined to stay away from drugs; he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and had cooperated by telling the police that there was another packet of drugs hidden in his jacket sleeve.
Accepting that the sentence could be enhanced for the aggravating feature of the applicant’s criminal record, the Court was urged not to enhance the sentence or, otherwise, to adopt a very short period of enhancement.
Reasons for sentence
The judge adopted a starting point of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, pursuant to the guidelines in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun.  She noted that the applicant, at the time of the offence a 66-year-old single man with a drug habit, had a substantial criminal record dating back to 1989.  Had it not been for the last substantial sentence for trafficking, the judge said she might have taken a more lenient approach, given the applicant’s drug dependence.  However, his last appearance, in which he was convicted of four counts of trafficking, showed him to be “an entrenched recidivist”, who had not committed a “one-off act” but was clearly “going to offend in some form or other until the day he dies”.
Accordingly, bearing in mind that deterrence was an overwhelming consideration, the judge enhanced the starting point by 1 ‍year, thus making 9 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.
Ground of appeal
Mr Wong Po Wing, on behalf of the applicant, submitted that, given the record of the applicant and the 34.51 grammes of ‘Ice’ involved, the 1-year enhancement was too high in all the circumstances, since it equated to an 11.7% increase of the original starting point of 8 years and 6 ‍months.  He referred to HKSAR v Le Huu Nghi, where the appellant had what were described as four similar previous convictions, although the judgment is silent as to the actual sentences and details of those offences, and the Court considered that the 6-month enhancement for his record, which amounted to a 10% increase of the starting point, was too high.
Mr Wong contended that i"

The prosecution case
Ms X’s evidence
It was the prosecution allegation that the applicant raped Ms ‍X, who was PW1 at trial, on 22 ‍November ‍2018 at a flat in Savoy Garden, Shatin, New Territories.  Ms X sold luxury watches and lived with her younger brother in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon.  She had been introduced to the applicant as a potential client by her then boyfriend, who was PW2 at trial, in October 2018.  Thereafter, Ms X and the applicant met up with each other socially a few times.  The applicant did not know that Ms X and PW2 were in a relationship.
On 21 November 2018, the applicant invited Ms X to a boat party, telling her that he would introduce her to potential clients for her business.  She said she would attend the boat party and the two met up in Central at about 7 pm that day.  There were some 10 women and several men on the boat, which subsequently set sail from Central to Causeway Bay.  On the boat, Ms X consumed several glasses of wine, but ate little.  She described her memory as vague and her limbs becoming weak.  The applicant had also been drinking.  When Ms X disembarked from the boat, the applicant assisted her to board a taxi but she soon lost consciousness inside the taxi.  The next thing she remembered was seeing the glass door of a building, which was not her own residential building.  She then lost consciousness again.
Ms X woke up on a bed, lying face-up.  The applicant, who was naked, was on top of her.  He managed to pull her underpants down to her thigh area, but Ms X pushed him away and pulled them back up.  The applicant then pulled away the crotch area of Ms X’s underpants and penetrated her vagina.  She closed her legs very tightly and pushed the applicant away with her left hand, her right hand covering her private parts.  At the same time, she told the applicant, “You are married.  You have a wife, and I am unwilling.  And we are only friends”.  Ms X said that although she did not see it, she felt that what penetrated her was the applicant’s penis rather than a finger because she could feel its warmth.  The applicant’s penis was inside her for 1 or 2 seconds, and the applicant was not wearing a condom.  After Ms X had pushed the applicant away, she developed a serious headache and lost consciousness again.
In the morning of 22 November 2018, Ms X woke up with her dress, bra and underpants on.  The applicant was lying on the bed next to her.  She then went to the toilet, threw away her sanitary pad and put on her dress.  When she came out of the bathroom, she saw the applicant naked on the bed.  When she sat on the bed to put on her shoes, the applicant grabbed her hand and said, “I suppose you would sleep for a longer while”.  Ms X then asked the applicant, “Last night nothing happened between both of us, right?”  The applicant said nothing.  She then left the flat.
Ms X went home and went to sleep.  At about 10 or 11 am, she woke up and thought over what had happened.  She was concerned, because she did not know if the applicant had further assaulted her after she had pushed him off her and lost consciousness.  Accordingly, she went to St Teresa’s Hospital in Kowloon, hoping to be examined in the Department of Gynaecology.  However, she was told an examination was not available, so she called other hospitals, but in vain.  Not knowing quite what to do, she dialled ‘999’ at 12:04 pm on 22 ‍November ‍2018.  Ms X was then told that she should make a report to the police, who would arrange a medical examination.
As a result of her ‘999’ call, police officers arrived at Ms X’s residence at 12:38 pm on 22 November 2018 in order to make enquiries.  ‍She was then escorted by a woman police constable to Queen ‍Elizabeth ‍Hospital for the purposes of a medical examination.
At about 10:24 pm that evening, police officers and Ms X went to Shatin, together with a social worker, to look for the flat where the incident allegedly took place.  She pointed to Artland Garden, but when the party went to a particular floor of the building, she was unable to identify the flat.

On 26 November 2024, the applicant was convicted after trial before Deputy District Court Judge Amy Chan (the judge) of one charge of riot, contrary to section 19(1) and (2) of the Public Order Ordinance (Cap 245) (Charge 1), and one charge of conspiracy to wound with intent, contrary to section 17(a) of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap 212) and sections 159A and 159C of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) (Charge 2).  On 23 December 2024, the applicant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 4 years and 1 month’s imprisonment on each charge.
On 15 January 2025, the applicant filed a notice of application for leave to appeal his convictions.
In the Amended Perfected Grounds of Appeal filed on 18 March 2025, Mr David Boyton, who represented the applicant at trial and on appeal, advanced the following four grounds of appeal:
“1.	Whether it is permissible in law for a tribunal of fact to consider the facts of an appellate judgment (of a co-conspirator or co-defendant), which may or may not have been covered in the evidence at trial.
Particulars
Immediately before delivering the verdict, the Court informed the parties that she had studied the facts in HKSAR v. TANG Wai-sum and others, CACC 171/2021, relating to the same incident/riot.
2. 	In relation to Charge 2, whether it is correct in law to convict a person with ‘conspiracy to wounding with intent’ when the intention and/or the foresight of that intention, is only limited to cause grievous bodily harm, particularly when that foresight and/or consequence would not cause necessary cause grievous bodily harm.
Particulars
At paragraphs 95 and 96 where the Court below found that, ‘D had the specific intent for wounding with intent.  I find that D foresaw grievous bodily harm as an inevitable consequence of hitting with wooden pole or rattan stick’.
DPP v. Smith [1961] AC 290.
3.	In relation to Charge 2, the Court erred in law and/or on the facts as the route to conviction was, inter alia, (1) by reason of the Applicant being an ‘accessory’ to the substantive offence; (2) on the belief that the hypothetical jury would find the necessary mens rea.
Particulars
At AB page 41-P [94] the Applicant, took part in the riot as ‘an accessory’.
At AB page 42-D [96] ‘believed’ that a jury would conclude that the specific intent for wounding which would be accepted by a jury.
4.	By reason of the above, the convictions are unsafe and unsatisfactory.”
Mr Boyton amended Ground 2 at the leave hearing in the following terms:
“In relation to Charge 2, whether it is correct in law to convict a person with ‘conspiracy to wound with intent’ when the foresight is to cause grievous bodily harm.”
Mr Boyton purported to frame the grounds of appeal as involving only questions of law, but it was clear that they concern issues of fact, essentially questioning whether the judge correctly applied a legal principle in her approach or findings under consideration.
During oral submissions, Mr Boyton abandoned his challenge of the applicant’s conviction on Charge 1, properly accepting that he could not sustain his argument under Ground 1.  He focused his submission on challenging the applicant’s conviction on Charge 2, the conspiracy to wound, based on the amended Ground 2 and Ground 3.  He advanced his arguments, accepting that the applicant participated in a riot in Yuen Long at around midnight on 22 July 2019 (Charge 1).
At the conclusion of the hearing, and after considering the submissions from the parties, I was not satisfied that the grounds of appeal against the convictions were reasonably arguable and leave to appeal was refused.  I indicated that I would give my reasons for my judgment in due course, which I now do.
The case at trial
This case concerned a riot that occurred on 22 July 2019 in the area of Long Wo Road and MTR Yuen Long Station (YL Station), Yuen Long, New Territories, where a serious clash occurred between two groups of people.  One group wore white tops and was armed with wooden poles or rattan sticks (the White Tops), and the other wore black tops, holding umbrellas, wearing caps and facemasks (the Black Tops).  The charges alleged that the applicant, together with Tang Wai-sum, Ng Wai-nam, and other persons (members of the White Tops) took part in the riot (Charge 1), and conspired to unlawfully and maliciously wound others (members of the Black Tops) with intent to cause them grievous bodily harm (Charge 2).

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
__________________________
The applicant was tried in the District Court before HH Judge Stanley Chan (“the judge”) on a charge of “using a false instrument”, contrary to section 73 of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap 200.  He was convicted after trial and was sentenced to a total term of 4 years’ imprisonment.  He seeks leave to appeal against his conviction and his sentence.
At the hearing of the application I granted the applicant leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence but was subsequently told that the applicant decided to abandon his appeal against sentence.  However, that ultimately did not happen and awaiting his decision on that issue caused delay in the handing down of this judgment.
The prosecution case
On 9 April 2018, the applicant, a Filipino national who had entered Hong Kong on 2 April as a visitor and was permitted to remain in Hong Kong till 16 April, visited the Main Building of The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (“HSBC”) at No 1 Queen’s Road Central with another Malaysian man and was seen by a member of the bank’s staff (“PW1”).  The Malaysian man at times assumed the role of interpreter although assistance to the applicant was unnecessary as the applicant understood English.  He would occasionally interpret what the applicant was saying into Chinese for PW1’s benefit but, again, this was unnecessary as PW1 spoke English.
The applicant presented a document (P1) to PW1, claiming that it represented a “heritage”, and repeatedly requesting to see the “Regional Head” of the HSBC global private banking with a view to the bank confirming P1.  P1 bore the heading “Slip Key Deposit Box Cash Dollar Deposit” and purported to have been issued by HSBC on 25 July 1983.  It asserted an extraordinary face value of US$943,000,000,000.  It also bore the applicant’s name and the account number “555734231551”.
The police were called and the applicant was arrested for the present offence.  The Malaysian man fled the building before the police arrived, and has not since been apprehended.
The falsity of P1 was established by the banker’s affirmation (P10) of a Mr Tang (“PW6”), the manager of the Operations Department of the HSBC, in which he confirmed that (i) no bank account was held with the HSBC in the applicant’s name and passport number; and (ii) the account number on P1 was not a valid account with HSBC.
The main dispute at trial was whether the applicant knew or believed P1 to be false and whether he intended to induce PW1 to accept it as genuine “and by reason of so accepting it to do some act to her own or any other person’s prejudice.”.
Dr Oliver Chan (“Dr Chan”), a psychiatrist called by the prosecution, had interviewed the applicant on seven occasions during his remand at Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre.  Dr Chan prepared a medical report dated 2 September 2019 (P4) which he adopted as his evidence.
In P4, Dr Chan stated that the applicant was able to elaborate in detail about his alleged relationship with the late President Marcos and his inheritance of “943 quadrillion US dollars” insured at Lloyd’s Bank in London.  At the end of his report, Dr Chan formed the view that the applicant appeared to have “an overvalued idea regarding the alleged inherited account”, however, in the absence of corroborative information or further material facts, he could not conclude that it was delusional, as his belief “originated from some existing documents or persons”.  In his testimony Dr Chan explained that “overvalued ideas” were “beliefs or ideas that could be understood given the person’s experience or context”.
In cross-examination, Dr Chan agreed that the applicant believed what he was saying “but it was not of the delusional level …because the origin of his belief was actually from some documents or person’s account that he was relying on”.  He said the applicant seemed to have fixated ideas about something, but he could not conclude that the applicant was suffering from a delusional disorder without the documents on which the applicant relied being proven to be false.  In the end, he accepted that he could not rule out that the applicant was suffering from a delusional disorder.
The defence case
The applicant elected not to testify but called one defence witness, Dr Gabriel Hung (“Dr Hung”), a psychiatrist who had visited the applicant once on 21 December 2018 during his remand at Stanley Prison and had prepared a medical report dated 17 January 2019 (DP1) which he adopted as his evidence at trial.

Before: Hon Macrae Acting CJHC in Court
Date of Hearing: 5 December 2023
Date of Judgment: 5 December 2023
The applicant pleaded not guilty before Deputy Judge Derek ‍Chan ‍SC (“the judge”) in the High Court to an indictment alleging a single count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134.  The applicant was convicted on 23 November 2021 and, on 3 January 2022, sentenced to 20 ‍years’ imprisonment.
The particulars of the indictment averred that on 28 ‍December ‍2018, at 35th Floor, Block 1 of Hong Ching House, Kai ‍Ching ‍Estate, Kai Tak in Kowloon, the applicant, together with Wu ‍Guoyi (“Wu”), unlawfully trafficked in a dangerous drug, namely 1 ‍kilogramme of a solid containing 922 grammes of cocaine hydrochloride.
On 14 January 2022, the applicant filed a formal Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against conviction.  The matter was first fixed for hearing in December 2022.  However, that hearing was vacated because the applicant had succumbed to Covid.
The undisputed facts
It was admitted by the applicant at trial, by way of two sets of Admitted Facts, made under section 65C of the Criminal Procedure ‍Ordinance, Cap 221, that at 23:02 hours on 28 ‍December ‍2018, she and Wu were intercepted by the police at the lift lobby of the address stated in the indictment.  Upon interception, DPC 7157 found inside a grey paper bag that was being carried by the applicant a green camouflage sweater, wrapped inside of which was a transparent re-sealable plastic bag containing another black plastic bag.  Inside the black plastic bag was a block wrapped in cling film and tin foil, which was later confirmed to be the dangerous drug particularised in the indictment.
The applicant and Wu were both arrested for trafficking in a dangerous drug.  Under caution, the applicant said, in Chinese,「我明白，我冇嘢講」.  Apart from the grey paper bag and the items inside, a dark coloured iPhone with the mobile telephone number 6763 6844 registered in the applicant’s name (“the dark iPhone”), and a white iPhone carrying an unregistered prepaid SIM card with mobile telephone number 5530 ‍0361 (“the ‍white iPhone”), were also found on and seized from the applicant.
Subsequently, the applicant took part in three video-‍recorded ‍interviews (“VRI”) with PW1 between 21:19 and 21:49 ‍hours on ‍29 ‍December ‍2018 (the 1st VRI); between 23:20 hours on 29 ‍December ‍2018 and 00:19 ‍hours on 30 December 2018 (the 2nd VRI); and between 16:33 and 18:39 hours on 30 December 2018 (the 3rd VRI) respectively.  The voluntariness of the three VRIs was not challenged.
Wu was subsequently charged with, but pleaded guilty to, the same count on which the applicant was tried in the present case.  He was committed to the High Court for sentence.  On the day the applicant’s trial commenced, Wu confirmed his plea of guilty before the High Court.
In December 2018, the average retail price of cocaine in Hong ‍Kong was HK$1,035 per gramme.  1 kilogram of cocaine would have been worth, therefore, some HK$1,035,000.
The prosecution case
The case for the prosecution essentially relied upon the evidence of a Mr Ching (“PW2”), a GoGoVan driver; the applicant’s three VRIs and three items of CCTV footage covering respectively Wang ‍Man ‍House of Cheung ‍Wang Estate in Tsing Yi, the ESSO petrol station in Yuen Long and Hong Ching House in Kai Tak at the material times.
PW2 testified that at about 21:35 hours on 28 December 2018, he successfully competed in respect of an order on the GoGoVan application (“App”) for a two legged journey from Tsing Yi to Yuen Long and then on to Kai Tak at a fare of HK$325.  When PW2 called the contact telephone number for the order, which was in fact a mobile telephone number registered in Wu’s name, a female voice answered the telephone.  The female instructed PW2 to go to the gate of Cheung Wang Estate in Tsing Yi and wait.
When PW2 arrived as instructed, he waited for about 5 ‍minutes.  He then saw the applicant and a man, who it was not disputed was Wu, arrive with some pet cages, some with mice in the cages.  Wu then loaded the cages onto the rear of the van.  After PW2 had confirmed with the applicant that he was the driver who had taken the order, and had closed the van door, Wu told PW2 to go to Transport Plaza in Yuen Long.  When they arrived in the vicinity of Transport Plaza, Wu instructed PW2 to stop the vehicle.  Wu got off the van, saying he needed to go to toilet, whilst PW2 and the applicant waited for him in the car.  During the wait, the applicant and PW2 alighted from the van, had a cigarette and chatted about pet mice.
After about 10 minutes, Wu returned and told PW2 to go to Kai Tak, where, upon arrival, the applicant paid PW2 HK$325 in cash.  PW2 said the applicant "

引言
本案原審時有四名被告（D1至D4）和八項控罪。申請人是D2，只涉及其中三罪，即控罪3‘非法禁錮’（只訴D2）、控罪4‘暴動’（訴D1至D3）和控罪5‘對他人身體加以嚴重傷害’（訴D1至D3）。審訊後，申請人被裁定控罪3和4成立，控罪5則改以較輕及交替性的‘襲擊致造成身體傷害’罪入罪，原審區域法院法官（李慶年法官）繼而把她處刑如下：
申請人不服判決，在被拒法援和沒有律師代表下同時就定罪和判刑提出上訴許可申請。單一法官駁回她的申請，申請人就向本庭重新提出申請。
控方說法
（背景）
本案和前內地記者付国豪先生（‘付’）在香港國際機場一號客運大樓離境大堂被禁錮和襲擊有關。‘付’是原審時的PW1，即控方第一證人。
上述事件，為時約五十分鐘，被控方劃分成兩個階段。第一階段是2019年8月13日晚11:30時至11:49時，第二階段是2019年8月13日晚11:49時至8月14日凌晨00:23時。
（案情概述）
第一階段是由‘付’舉機拍攝，被已聚集的大批示威者質疑、包圍、拉扯和用強光照射開始。示威者不但毆打‘付’、肆意搜查‘付’的個人物件和拉下‘付’的褲子，而且還用膠索帶和膠紙把‘付’困綁在一台行李車上。有關行為構成了‘非法集結’和‘非法禁錮’。
第二階段是第一階段的延續，但涉及的暴力有增無減而申請人亦開始被鏡頭拍到在現場出現。有關兩個階段的過渡、申請人在第二階段的行為，以及事件在持續演化中所衍生出的‘暴動’和簡稱‘襲擊’罪，由原審法官解釋及撮要如下：
「	34. 	早前的非法集結非但仍然持續，並同樣以PW1為目標。控方的基礎是自PW1坐在行李車上開始被綁上索帶之時，因為所出現的暴力的規模和程度的提升，本身是非法集結的情形，已經演變成為暴動（控罪四），而D1、D2和D3及其他片段拍得但未被控的人士共同參與其中。
35.	控方認為，參與上述暴動期間，D1、D2和D3個人和共同對PW1的身體加以嚴重傷害（控罪五）。
36.	首先，8月13日晚上約11:48開始，PW1被強行放在行李車上，被集結群眾包圍，手腕和手指被索帶捆綁，雙手被拉起至超越自己的頭頂及被鐳射光或強光照射。他的藍色上衣再次被舉起，然後被放在他的大腿上。
37.	第二，約晚上11:49，PW1說：「我支持香港警察，你可以打我了」。在這個階段，PW1除手部外，他的腳部亦被綁上索帶，亦有人用強光照射他的面部。
38.	第三，約23:51，有人把PW1的證件打開，時任立法會議員郭家麒和張超雄出現。PW1在這段時間一直被人包圍。他曾被人在其手部和腳部綁上索帶、被人淋水。而控方指稱第二被告人（束短辮女子，以下簡稱女子A）亦出現在PW1的身旁，手持索帶，蹲在付先生的身旁，雙手向付先生有所動作。
39.	第四，約23:56，行李車開始移動一段約數米距離，並於約23:57到達G段牆邊的位置。在牆邊的時候，郭家麒大部分時間都在PW1的左手邊，而PW1的右手邊有一名身穿紫色上衣的人士（女子A）。他們均沒有戴口罩。
40.	第五，2019年8月14日約00:03 ，PW1由本來坐直在行李車上，因有人強行把他的手提電話放近他手中用他的拇指解鎖，因此他把右邊身體躺向右側面，然後有其他人嘗試用另一部手提電話解鎖，因此他強行反方向，把身體倒向左側面。
41.	第六，在牆邊的時候，PW1仍然被人綁上索帶，並被人淋水、用強光和雷射光束照射、被人用手襲擊面和頭（此時，PW1用普通話自言自語，他在庭上解釋原因是不知將會發生甚麼更嚴重的事，所以說出自己想說的話，並希望這些說話被記錄下來，以防遭遇不測無法面對家人的情況）。控方指稱為第三被告（戴猙獰小丑面罩的男子，以下簡稱男子B）在付先生的身旁有所行為及有所說話。控方指稱女子A亦在場並戴上手套。
42.	第七，約00:07 ，女子A和男子B有所動作，PW1被強行拉離行李車。當離開行李車後，PW1身體仍然一直側躺，拉走他的人和附近的人便襲擊他（此時女子A倒在地上，要人攙扶）。約00:08 ，D1（D1沒有爭議該人就是他）越過前方集結人群中的其他人士進入PW1的核心範圍內並襲擊PW1。
43.	第八，約00:09至00:10，身穿急救反光衣的人和張超雄出現在PW1的身邊。郭家麒跟著在PW1的身邊出現。該些身穿急救反光衣的人隨即剪斷綁着PW1雙手的黑白色索帶，並對PW1進行救治。
44.	第九，消防處救護員約00:16穿過人群到達PW1的身邊。女子A走到郭家麒的身邊有所對話，其後離開。救護員於約00:20把PW1抬上擔架床上，並把PW1移離G行段。」
（警誡供詞）
申請人在案發後被捕。警誡下，申請人表示：「我無意中見到當時『公安』覺得好嬲，自己上前抽水2下，亦無意中見到有『索帶』先上前綁佢，其他人都唔識，咩都唔知，我無嘢講。」在其後的兩次的錄影警誡會面紀錄，申請人則對上述的招認作出了進一步解釋。
（人物辨認）
原審法官指出：
「	47. 	就辨認證據方面，控方根據：(i) D2的招認；(ii) 案發當日（8月13日晩上至翌日）的片段和截圖呈現女子A的外貌、衣著和行蹤，邀請法庭對比在不同時段的片段/截圖呈現的目標女子/女子A/被捕人的外貌、衣著和行蹤，包括：
(1)	事發前，8月13日約下午12時多，目標女子離開青衣住所時的外貌、衣著和行蹤；
(2)	事發前，8月13日約晚上22:27時，目標女子在機場便利店的外貌、衣著和行蹤；
(3)	事發後，8月14日約清晨5時多，目標女子返回青衣住所時的外貌、衣著和行蹤；
(4)	事發後，8月19日，警方在上述青衣住所拘捕D2後向她拍攝的照片。
48.	上述對比能確立女子A（犯案人）/目標女子/被捕女子（即片段及附表2附載的截圖所標記的人士）是同一人，就是D2。」
辯方立場
（特別議題）
申請人不爭議警誡供詞的自願性，但要求法庭基於公平原則把有關的口頭招認和錄影會面紀錄剔除，理由是她有腦疾，影響到她對警誡的理解。為此，辯方還傳召了一名精神科醫生作證。
（主議題）
申請人選擇不作供。
綜合而言，辯方的立場可撮要為以下六點：
(一)	申請人沒有作出控方所指的行為。
(二)	控方未能證明在場人士有「共同目的」破壞社會安寧。
(三)	申請人沒有參與任何暴動。
(四)	即使法庭把申請人的警誡供詞納入證據也不應給予比重。
(五)	申請人沒有和其他人有共同犯罪的計劃。
(六)	‘付’的傷勢不構成嚴重身體傷害。
原審裁決
（特別議題）
在評核過控辯雙方的專家證據後，原審法官信納控方專家的證供而不接受辯方專家的證供，並裁定沒有任何理由須酌情剔除申請人的任何一項警誡供詞。
（主議題）
原審法官裁定所有控方證人皆誠實可靠，可信納他們的證供。
原審法官根據現場錄影和其他證據裁定：在第一階段，事件已構成‘非法集結’和‘非法禁錮’；在第二階段，身處現場即包括‘付’、外籍記者、張超雄、郭家麒及其他嘗試勸阻者在內的人，均害怕或擔心其人身或財產可能受到損害，而且激進人群對‘付’所使用的暴力也實質破壞了社會安寧，所以不但延續了‘付’的‘非法禁錮’而且還構成‘暴動’。
原審法官進一步裁定：申請人的警誡供詞，簡單直接地承認了自己襲擊‘付’和用索帶捆綁‘付’；上述的招認和在現場錄得的畫面完全吻合；錄影裡的犯案女子在影片中露出了部分甚至整張臉龐，樣子和申請人被拘捕後的照片完全一樣；該女子指稱郭家麒非禮時的聲線、語氣，以及發音，也和申請人的錄影會面及庭上多次發言相同；是故犯案女子必然就是申請人。
原審法官最終裁定：申請人用索帶協助捆綁‘付’，行為構成‘非法禁錮’；她從行李車拉走‘付’，令其他人可襲擊‘付’，再加上她不斷阻礙救護員的救援，就是和別人共同破壞社會安寧及有意圖地參與了‘暴動’；然而‘付’的傷勢不算「嚴重傷害」，所以控罪5只能改以‘襲擊致造成身體傷害’罪入罪。
原審判刑
申請人判刑時25歲，中三程度，已婚，被捕時無業。辯方在求情時側重申請人的個人背景，指她的腦疾會令她較常人魯莽衝動，再者就是病情會對她的監獄生活造成負擔。
就‘非法禁錮’罪，原審法官裁定：此罪雖然沒有上訴法庭的量刑指引，但本案的案情實屬嚴重；‘付’被禁錮50分鐘，期間被多人多番侮辱、謾罵和毆打；申請人夥同別人行事，不但令‘付’受傷，而且也令他損失財物；縱觀一切因素，此罪的量刑基準應為入獄12個月，申請人有腦疾，酌情扣減四分一，刑期就下調至9個月。
就‘暴動’罪，原審法官裁定：梁天琦案所辨識的量刑原則和十二個考慮因素適用；本案的暴動沒有預謀，參與人數約40，沒有使用武器，但歷時50分鐘，即使有人嘗試勸阻，但參與者不但沒有停止反而對‘付’暴打兩分鐘；暴動在具地標性的香港國際機場發生，令香港蒙羞，對社群影響甚深；現場有大量示威者，情緒或會被挑撥而變得激動，令情況失控；參與暴動者的行為，對公共秩序和社會安寧造成嚴重和逼切的威脅；參與者在犯案時戴上口罩，增加了調查的難度，是加刑因素；總體而言，本案屬於「中度罪責」，量刑基準應為5至6年監禁；申請人有六項前科，在2019年11月更同因‘暴動’罪而被判入獄46個月，所以此罪的量刑基準須被提高至5年9個月；經酌情扣減四分一後，最終刑期就是51個月。
就‘襲擊致造成身體傷害’罪，原審法官裁定：此罪的情節嚴重，曾有多人以不同角色參與襲擊‘付’；申請人聯同另一人將‘付’拉走，引發‘付’被其他人毆打約兩分鐘；凡此種種皆顯示本罪須處以一阻嚇性刑罰，合適的量刑基準因此是入獄12個月；經酌情扣減四分一，最終刑期就下調至9個月。
原審法官認為，有關三罪有相當重疊，所有刑期理應同期執行，即合共51個月（4年3個月），但當中的3年須與申請人的另案在服刑期分期執行。
上訴理由
申請人先後向法庭存檔過六份書面陳詞。經疏理後，她的上訴理由可撮要如下。
針對定罪：
(一)	申請人沒有連同其他人計劃破壞任何物品及或使用武器。
(二)	控方須證明她有連同其他人計劃或煽動他人破壞社會安寧。
(三)	她獨自去到機場，不認識在場的任何人，不可能發起破壞機場。
(四)	當天她只有兩條索帶和口罩，沒有可能導致‘付’受嚴重傷害。
(五)	她有長期病患，不可能非法禁錮‘付’。
(六)	控方須證明她煽動他人非法禁錮和襲擊‘付’致受嚴重傷害。
(七)	一名叫「曹任文」的律師沒有理會她個人的意願、要求她不認罪和一直拒絕讓她在原審出庭作供。
(八)	醫生專家也拒絕讓她出庭作供，但她已對此醫生專家是誰沒有太大印象。
至於刑期，申請人則認為是「太重」：
她沒有攻擊性武器或會令人嚴重受傷甚至死亡的物品。

正如答辯方的書面陳詞指出，無論針對定罪或判刑，申請人提出的所謂上訴理由，均屬事實認定的範疇而且跟有關三項定罪的構成根本無關。例如，三項定罪不在乎是否有使用武器、也不在乎是否有破壞物品，更不在乎申請人或其他參與者是否有預謀組織計劃及是否曾煽動別人加入犯案。同樣，原審法官已改判申請人較輕的‘襲擊致造成身體傷害’罪，所以‘付’是否受到嚴重傷害其實亦已無關"

Hon Macrae VP (giving the Reasons for Judgment of the Court):
On 6 January 2022, the applicant was convicted of one count of attempted rape, contrary to sections 118(1) and 159G of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap 200, following a trial before Deputy Judge Bruce (“the ‍judge”) and a jury at the Court of First Instance.  He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.
On 17 January 2022, the applicant, acting in person, filed a notice of application for leave to appeal against conviction (Form XI), which was subsequently refused by the Single Judge on 5 October 2022.  Full reasons for his decision were given by the Single Judge at the time.
On 13 October 2022, the applicant filed a notice seeking to renew his application for leave to appeal against conviction (Form XIII) and, on 21 December 2023, appeared in person at the hearing of his renewed application.  Having heard arguments from the applicant and the respondent, we refused the application, saying that we would hand down the reasons for our decision in due course.  This we now do.
The prosecution case
The victim of the attempted rape was a 9-year-old girl, referred to as “X” throughout the proceedings.  The medical evidence was that X was significantly mentally incapacitated and had the mental age of a 3-year-old child.  The offence took place on 8 October 2019 in a room at a guesthouse in Chungking Mansions, which was rented and occupied by the applicant at the time.
In March 2016, “A”, a Mongolian national, had made a torture claim after arriving in Hong Kong.  She later arranged for her twin children, X and a boy referred to at trial as “B”, to come to Hong ‍Kong on 12 July 2018 to live with her.  The applicant had come to know A through her boyfriend from Bangladesh, who also happened to be a friend of the applicant.
On 7 October 2019, A had a dispute with her boyfriend and, accordingly, went to the applicant’s residence with X and B to spend the night.  The children would refer to the applicant as “Uncle Jo Jo”.
In the early hours of 8 October 2019, A went to do her washing in the corridor outside the applicant’s room, leaving the children alone with the applicant in his room.  There was a bed in the room, with a mattress on the floor beneath it.  B was lying on the mattress on the floor, playing with his mobile telephone, while the applicant was lying on the bed.  There came a time when X got onto the bed occupied by the applicant.  The prosecution alleged that the applicant removed X’s underwear, as well as his own, before sexually assaulting and raping X.  She said that the applicant tried to put his finger into her vagina, and “punched” her belly, which was painful.  She said he kept pushing, trying to penetrate her vagina.  He also sucked her cheek with his mouth.
At this time, B heard his sister cry out.  He got up to see what was happening and saw, albeit somewhat obscured by a blanket, the applicant and X both naked below the waist.  X then made a complaint to B that the applicant was touching the part between her legs and he had shut her mouth and sucked her cheek.  About 5 minutes later, A returned to the room, whereupon B told her that X was naked.  A pulled back the blanket and saw both the applicant and X naked below the waist.  Having replaced X’s underpants, she then took some photographs, showing a substantial area of redness on X’s private parts.  A then left the guesthouse with the children and returned to their own residence.
The matter was reported to the police and both X and B were escorted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where they were examined by a forensic pathologist.  X’s hymen was intact, but there was a 0.2 cm tear to the posterior fourchette of her labia minora, which was bleeding slightly.  It was the opinion of the forensic pathologist that the injury could have been the result of penetration by an erect penis, or by a finger fondling the private parts of X.
In a video-recorded interview, the applicant agreed that he was in the same room with X and B at the material time, but denied any sexual misconduct, contending that A and her children had fabricated the complaint against him.  He said that at the time A was sitting on the bed, B was under the bed and X was lying on the bed with him.  The applicant claimed that X had pulled on his pyjama pants, as a result of which A had scolded her.  Essentially, his account was that if anything had happened between them, it was initiated by X and he had stopped her.
Both X and B participated in video-recorded interviews, which were adduced into evidence pursuant to section 79C of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, Cap 221, and both were cross-exa"

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
_________________________
Hon McWalters JA (giving the Reasons for Judgment of the court):
The applicant was jointly charged with one other with a single count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, namely, 1,309 grammes of a solid containing 549 grammes of cocaine, contrary to section 4(1)(a) and (3) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134.  On 3 August 2016, the applicant and his co-accused (D2) both appeared before DHCJ Lugar-Mawson and both pleaded guilty to the count.  On 9 January 2018, the applicant was sentenced by M Poon J (“the judge”) to 14 years and 5 months’ imprisonment and D2 was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment.
The applicant subsequently filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against sentence (Form XI).  However, on 19 June 2018, he filed a Notice of Abandonment in respect of this Application for Leave to Appeal, as a consequence of which his appeal was dismissed pursuant to Rule 39 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, Cap 221A.
On 7 November 2018, the applicant made and filed an affirmation seeking to revive his application for leave to appeal his sentence by treating his earlier abandonment of it as a nullity.  He, thereafter, filed two further affirmations with medical reports attached to them.  The medical reports were relied on by the applicant to show that his earlier abandonment was not the result of a deliberate and informed decision by him.
At the hearing of the application, we refused it.  These are our reasons for doing so.
The background to the offence
The Summary of Facts, which was admitted by the applicant and used for his sentencing, revealed that on 24 April 2015, the applicant was observed by police officers handing a white plastic shopping bag to D2 outside a shop on Cheung Sha Wan Road, Sham Shui Po.  The officers then approached, stopped and searched both men.  They found a total of 549 grammes of cocaine, wrapped in 74 plastic pellets in the shopping bag that D2 was by then holding. The street value of the cocaine was HK$1,500,114 at the time of its seizure.
Under caution, both the applicant and D2 denied any involvement in the offence but in the Summary of Facts the applicant admitted having committed the offence.
The procedural history of the applicant’s case
During a pre-trial review on 7 June 2016 before Zervos J, as Zervos JA then was, the applicant and D2, through their legal representatives, indicated that they would maintain their pleas of not guilty and would stand trial between 2 and 15 August 2016.
However, counsel for the applicant subsequently wrote to the court informing it that the applicant would plead guilty on the first day of trial.  Those acting for D2 indicated the same intention.  On the day before the scheduled trial date, the applicant’s counsel wrote to the court again, stating that the applicant wished to provide assistance to the prosecution.
On 3 August 2016, both the applicant and D2 pleaded guilty before DHCJ Lugar-Mawson, and admitted the Summary of Facts.  The applicant’s mitigation was reserved until after the police had obtained non-prejudicial statements from him.  When the applicant learnt that the police had assessed his statements to be of no practical value, he applied to reverse his guilty plea and discharged his counsel.  He was thereafter represented by Mr James McGowan who informed DHCJ Lugar-Mawson that issues relating to the applicant’s mental condition and fitness to plead would have to be investigated by the court as part of the application to reverse his guilty plea.  On 25 October 2016, the applicant’s case came on before DHCJ Lugar-Mawson who ordered a psychiatric report on the applicant.  A further hearing took place on 2 November 2017 before Li J for procedural matters to be addressed.
Finally, on 15 December 2017, Mr McGowan on behalf of the applicant withdrew the application to reverse plea and maintained the applicant’s guilty plea.  The case was then adjourned to 9 January 2018 for mitigation and sentence of both the applicant and D2, at which time M Poon J took over this case.
The mitigation
The applicant relied on the fact that he was of a clear record, was not a torture claimant, albeit he had overstayed in Hong Kong, and had provided assistance to Father Wotherspoon’s letter-writing campaign.
Mr McGowan also informed the judge that the applicant would rely on entrapment as a mitigating factor.  He submitted that the evidence suggested that the applicant "

On 20 December 2024, the applicant pleaded guilty before Deputy Judge M Chow (“the judge”) in the District Court to a single charge of Possession of a dangerous drug, namely 4.95 grammes of a solid containing 3.99 grammes of cocaine, contrary to section 8(1)(a) and (2) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap 134.  On 8 January 2025, he was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment.  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence, although he has served it completely and already been discharged from prison on 3 May 2025.
Facts agreed by the applicant
The facts, which the applicant agreed, were that on 24 March 2024, at 12:06 am, he was observed wandering around Ching Yuk House, Tsz Ching Estate in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon.  When a team of police officers on anti-crime patrol in the area approached him, he lowered his head and quickly walked away.  One of the officers (PW1), however, intercepted the applicant, revealed his police identity and asked him what he was doing.  The applicant said he was looking for his friend but could not explain where his friend was.  He was then searched and in the right pocket of his trousers were found:
One plastic bag containing 3 stapled plastic bags, inside of which were 0.87 grammes of a solid containing 0.73 grammes of cocaine.
One plastic bag containing 14 stapled plastic bags, inside of which were 4.08 grammes of a solid containing 3.26 grammes of cocaine.
HK$9,859 in cash (in the form of eleven HK$100 notes, thirty-eight HK$50 notes, eight HK$20 notes and other coins of different denominations).
The applicant was also found in possession of two mobile telephones.  Under caution, he claimed that the cocaine was for his own consumption.  The estimated street value of the cocaine was HK$4,499.50.
Mitigation and sentence
Ms Law, who appeared for the applicant in the District Court, as she does today with Mr Hui, submitted in mitigation that her client was aged 23, unemployed and of clear record.  It was submitted that no part of the drug in question was for dissemination (this submission was said to be supported by the fact that no measuring equipment or tools for distributing the drug was found in the applicant’s possession).
The judge was told that the applicant had been given pocket money of about HK$10,000 from his parents (out of a joint family income of HK$50,000), which had gone to finance his purported drug habit, but she noted that the source of his funds was “a mere assertion from the bar table”.
Before passing sentence, the judge called for a Drug ‍Addiction Treatment Centre report, from which she noted that the applicant had claimed that he started to abuse cocaine (in addition to cannabis) in February 2023, and last took drugs in September 2023.  However, his urine test of 26 March 2024 revealed a negative result for dangerous drugs.
With regard to the small quantity of cocaine in the applicant’s possession, the judge used 12 months’ imprisonment as the starting point for the offence, which she enhanced by 18 months for the ‘latent risk factor’.  Since the applicant had tendered a timely plea in the District Court, she gave him a one-third discount and reduced the enhanced sentence from 30 months’ (or 2½ years’) imprisonment to 20 months’ (or 1 year and 8 months’) imprisonment.
Grounds of appeal
Mr Hui, with him Ms Law, has advanced two grounds of appeal.  By Ground 1, it is argued that the judge’s finding as to the fact of latent risk was wrong in principle.  By Ground 2, it is contended that an enhancement of 18 months to reflect any such latent risk was manifestly excessive and disproportionate to the starting point, when compared with previous appellate authority.
Respondent’s submissions
Ms Au, for the respondent, has submitted that the real possibility of dissemination of the dangerous drug was supported by the circumstances, namely, the fact of 17 ‍small bags of cocaine in the applicant’s possession, together with a sizeable quantity of cash and two mobile telephones, on the street after midnight; and that, absent any upper limit for enhancement laid down by the Court, the judge was entitled to substantially increase the starting point by 18 months’ imprisonment in the present case.
Consideration
As a Single Judge, my task in this application is to determine whether it is reasonably arguable that the sentence is wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.  Whilst the applicant claimed under caution that the drug was for his own consumption, that self-serving statement was doubted by the judge (as early as the first hearing before her) as being at variance with the overall circumstances of the case, including the objective facts that t"

On 22 January 2025, he was sentenced by D Yau J (“the judge”) to 6 years and 1 month’s imprisonment.
By his Form XI Notice filed on 13 February 2025, the applicant now seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.
The admitted facts
In the evening of 2 April 2022, during an anti-narcotics operation, the police took the opportunity to enter Room 2110, Hoi ‍Yan ‍House, Hoi Fu Court, Mong Kok (“the Flat”) when Ms ‍Hon ‍Yin-‍hiu opened the door for two visitors.  The applicant, being the Flat’s registered tenant, was lying on a bed inside the premises.
Six re-sealable plastic bags containing 8.49 grammes of methamphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known as “Ice”, were found on Ms Hon after a body search.
On a table in the Flat, the police found a metal box with the following contents:
4 re-sealable plastic bags containing totally 17.0 grammes of “Ice”;
An electronic scale;
Multiple re-sealable plastic bags contained in a larger re-‍sealable plastic bag;
2 glass bottles each attached with a straw, resembling pipes for smoking drugs.
Besides these items, 3 plastic bags containing 14.4 grammes of herbal cannabis were also found inside a pouch on a bedside desk.
Upon arrest and under caution, the applicant said that the “Ice” and cannabis were for his own consumption and occasional sharing with friends.  In a cautioned video recorded interview, Ms Hon claimed that the “Ice” found on her had been given to her for free by the applicant, whom she had known for about a month.
The applicant was charged with trafficking in the 17.0 ‍grammes of “Ice” and 14.4 grammes of herbal cannabis found inside the Flat, the street value of which was HK$9,895.60 and HK$2,621 respectively.  Notwithstanding his cautioned statement upon arrest, the applicant eventually admitted the charge.
Background of the applicant
In mitigation, it was said that the applicant was brought up in a modest family in the mainland.  At 21, he came to Hong Kong in pursuit of a better life.  However, marginalised and frustrated by society, he descended into a life of crime and bad habits.  At the time of sentencing, the applicant was a former drug abuser aged 68, with 20 previous convictions, for which he has served more than 20 years in prison as follows:
Reasons for sentence
Acknowledging the applicant’s humble background and the difficulties he had encountered in life, including various health issues, the judge dealt with the major aspect of mitigation put forward on his behalf, namely, the contention that he consumed a significant portion of the drugs himself.  The applicant did not give evidence in support of his contention and the judge found the claim to be unsubstantiated, indeed contradicted by the evidence.  Accordingly, he declined to give the applicant any reduction in sentence for this factor.
The judge then applied the 6-step approach of HKSAR v Herry ‍Jane Yusuph, identifying the applicant’s role as a “storekeeper”; and, by arithmetically applying the applicable guidelines, adopted a starting point of 7½ years’ imprisonment for trafficking in 17.0 grammes of “Ice”.
The quantity of herbal cannabis was found to be insignificant such that the judge ignored it when calculating the starting point.  However, as trafficking in more than one type of drug was an aggravating factor, the judge enhanced the starting point by 1 month.
The judge further found the applicant to be a persistent offender, for which he enhanced the sentence by a further 6 months, taking the overall starting point to 8 years and 1 month’s imprisonment.  The judge said:
“36.	The defendant has a number of convictions for very serious offences.  Although this is his first conviction for trafficking in dangerous drugs, and his only other drug related conviction was in 2019 for simple possession, I find that I must place more weight on the need to deter the defendant from committing further offences in the future when sentencing…”
The sole functional mitigating factor was that the applicant had pleaded guilty.  However, since he did so about a month after the trial dates were fixed in the High Court, the applicant was given a discount of about 25% for his late plea, in accordance with HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam, resulting in a sentence of 6 years and 1 month’s imprisonment, which the judge considered to be in line with the totality principle.

The applicant applied for leave to appeal against his sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment imposed by Deputy Judge Colin Wong (“the ‍judge”) in the District Court on 15 January 2024, following his pleas of guilty to the following nine charges in two separate cases, namely:
DCCC 1079/2022 & 709/2023 (“Case 1”): two theft charges of an ATM card and an identity card; (Charges 1 and 2); one charge of using an identity card relating to another person (Charge 3); three charges of conspiracy to defraud (Charges ‍4, 5 and 7); and one charge of handling stolen goods (Charge ‍6); and

In pleading guilty to all of the charges, the applicant admitted two sets of facts detailing the background and evidence relevant to each case.  The facts which constituted the individual charges arose in this way.

When Luk met with an unknown man, he checked through his online banking application that two cheque deposits, to a total sum of HK$207,000, had been made to his account and he duly handed over the 3rd watch.

On 31 ‍March 2022, Wong met with the applicant who claimed to have transferred HK$250,500 to his mother’s account by showing a screen capture of the bank transfer.  Wong duly passed the 1st watch to the applicant.

Later on 31 March 2022, Wong received a WhatsApp message from the buyer claiming that an extra $250,500 had been transferred to his mother’s account and requesting that reimbursement be made to a recipient named Tai ‍Ka Kui (with a telephone number and bank account held by another person named Chung Fuk Chow).  On 1 ‍April ‍2022, the two cheques deposited into the mother’s bank account were dishonoured.

________________
The Secretary for Justice applies for an extension of time to appeal by way of case stated the acquittal of the respondent in the District Court for the offence of dangerous driving causing death pursuant to section 84 of the District Court Ordinance (Cap 336).
Section 84 provides that the Secretary for Justice can appeal by way of case stated to the Court of Appeal against a verdict or order of acquittal on a question of law only.  It is stipulated under section 84(a) that “within 7 clear days after the reasons for a verdict have been recorded or after the order of acquittal, or within such further period as a judge of the High Court may, whether before or after the expiration of such period, allow, an application may be made in writing to the judge to state a case setting forth the facts and the grounds on which the verdict or order was arrived at or made and the grounds on which the proceeding is questioned for the opinion of the Court of Appeal …”.  (Emphasis added)
The respondent faced trial in the District Court before Deputy District Judge M H Tsui (the judge) for the offence of dangerous driving causing death.  The offence alleged that the respondent, a driver of a public light bus, at around 9:47 pm on 13 April 2023 while executing a right-hand turn at the traffic light junction on Lai Chi Kok Road, entered the pedestrian crossing resulting in the bus’s offside front striking the deceased, who was using the pedestrian crossing at the time.  The respondent was following the traffic control signal, which was green for vehicular traffic, while the deceased was facing a red light for the pedestrian crossing.  There was little dispute between the parties as to what took place that evening, as most of the evidence was admitted.  The respondent’s defence was that as he was making his right hand turn, he was keeping a lookout for vehicles to his left and did not look to his right.  The offside front of the respondent’s vehicle knocked down the deceased, who was crossing the pedestrian crossing against a red light.  The deceased was a few steps away from the pedestrian island in the centre of the roadway.  There was another pedestrian who was using the crossing at the time in front of the deceased, and at the time of the collision he was already located at the pedestrian island.  The respondent neither testified nor called evidence on his behalf, but relied on the out-of-court statements that he had made to the police at the time of the incident.
On 6 February 2025, the judge handed down her reasons for verdict.  She found that the evidence did not support the allegation that the respondent’s manner of driving was dangerous.  She stated that the respondent approached a pedestrian crossing but failed to look to his right.  Although this was careless, it did not fall to the degree that his manner of driving fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver.  She stated this was a momentary lapse of concentration that involved seconds in terms of duration.  She acquitted the respondent of the charge of dangerous driving causing death but found him guilty of the offence of careless driving.
Section 84 mandates the time period for the Secretary for Justice to appeal by way of case stated an acquittal within 7 clear days after the reasons for a verdict have been recorded or after the order of acquittal.
The application by the Secretary for Justice to appeal by way of case stated the order of acquittal was filed on 6 March 2025, which was 17 days out of time.
As directed under section 84, the basis for an appeal by way of case stated of an order of acquittal is on a question of law only.  The Secretary for Justice advances this appeal on the basis that no reasonable tribunal of fact, applying its mind to the proper considerations and giving itself the proper directions, could have come to the finding that the respondent’s driving manner was only careless, not dangerous in the circumstances of the present case.  Essentially, it is submitted that the respondent’s vehicle was making a right-hand turn approaching a pedestrian crossing, and therefore the respondent should have paid particular attention to pedestrians and traffic conditions when approaching a traffic light controlled pedestrian crossing: HKSAR v Cheung Kwok Leung .  The intended appeal on the basis that the judge’s finding as to the respondent’s manner of driving was irrational and no reasonable judge would have reached such a conclusion is a high hurdle to overcome.  However, ther"

The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted robbery (Count 1) and one count of robbery (Count 2) before Douglas Yau J (the judge) in the High Court on the first day of trial.  On 11 March 2025, the judge sentenced him to a total term of 11 years’ imprisonment.
On 21 March 2025, the applicant filed a notice of application  for leave to appeal against the sentence.  He complained that his sentence was manifestly excessive (Ground 1), and that the judge failed adequately to consider the mitigating factors advanced on his behalf (Ground 2).
In letters dated 23 June and 16 July 2025, the applicant elaborated on his grounds of appeal.  He argued that the judge failed properly to consider mitigating factors that would have justified a further reduction in his sentence.  These factors included his personal circumstances (old age, ill health, financial hardship, good character, and charity work); the circumstances of the offences and his reasons for committing them; his assistance to the police; his explanation for his late guilty pleas; his previous three years’ imprisonment for convictions later quashed on appeal; and his low risk of reoffending due to anticipated deportation to Singapore after serving his sentence.
At the leave hearing on 4 November 2025, the applicant appeared in person, having had legal aid refused on 12 May 2025.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I granted the applicant leave to appeal his sentence and an appeal aid certificate so that he would be legally represented on his appeal.  I said I would hand down my reasons in due course.  These are my reasons.
In order to have a proper understanding of this case, it should be noted that the applicant is an elderly man who is diminutive in stature and nonthreatening in appearance.  His date of birth is 28 March 1949, and he was in his 70s when he committed the two robbery offences, which he claimed he did out of desperation to pay his rent.
In entering a plea of guilty to both counts, the applicant agreed to a summary of facts outlining the circumstances of the offences.  On the evening of 1 July 2020, the applicant attempted to rob a cashier (PW1) at a Mannings store in Prince Edward by thrusting a note at him that read in Chinese, “Robbery!  Surrender the money if you want to live, hurry, or you will be burned with gasoline” (Count 1).  PW1 was not scared and did not react.  The applicant took out a lighter and a bottle of clear liquid, but PW1 remained unfazed.  PW1 scolded him and forced him to leave.  The applicant fled, leaving the note behind.  The incident was captured on a CCTV camera in the store.  However, the applicant was not apprehended at the time.
Almost two years later, the applicant committed the other robbery offence.  On the afternoon of 14 April 2022, the applicant robbed a bank teller (PW2) of HK$14,000 at a bank in Yau Ma Tei.  He posed as a customer and handed PW2 a note that read in Chinese, “Robbery, we have gun, quickly put the money in the bag, failure to cooperate, we will shoot” (Count 2).  PW2 triggered a discreet alarm to notify her manager, while the applicant pointed a pistol-like object at her and gave her a bag for the money.  When PW2 began counting the cash, he warned her to stop counting or otherwise she would be dead.  She then placed a total of HK$14,000 into his bag and gave it to him.  He fled with the money, leaving the note behind.  The robbery was witnessed by other bank staff and captured on a CCTV camera in the bank.  That night, the police arrested the applicant at his residence, where they seized items associated with the robbery, including an air-gun, HK$5,750 in cash, a windbreaker, a mask, a cap, sunglasses, an Octopus card, bags and clothing.  Under caution, he admitted robbing the bank because he was in debt and asked for a chance.
The police file for the attempted robbery offence (Count 1) had been closed, and the applicant’s conviction for this offence was based on his admissions in his video recorded interviews.  He explained that in relation to that matter, the bottle of clear liquid contained water.  He also made full admissions in relation to the robbery offence (Count 2), explaining that he used some of the stolen money to buy a bag, top up his Octopus card, and pay his rent.
The applicant, a Singaporean national, at the time of sentence, was nearly 76 years old with a clear record.  He lost contact with his wife after moving to "

________________
The applicant faced a single charge of robbery in the District Court before Judge E Yip (the judge), where it was alleged that the applicant stole a box of durian at knife point from a shop at a fruit market.  On the first day of trial on 26 July 2021, he pleaded not guilty to robbery but indicated a plea of guilty to the lesser charge of theft, which was rejected by the prosecution.  The trial for the robbery charge proceeded before the judge, who, at the close of the prosecution case, ruled that there was no case to answer for the robbery offence, but a case to answer for the offence of theft.  On 28 July 2021, the applicant was convicted on his own plea to theft, having agreed a Summary of Facts.  The judge sentenced the applicant to 14 months’ imprisonment.  On 6 August 2021, the applicant was released from custody having served his sentence.
The applicant is a Form 8 Recognizance holder, whose refoulement application has been refused.  As a result of his immigration status, he was required to report to the Immigration Department, but stopped doing so in November 2022.  He was placed on a wanted list and subsequently arrested.  Since 12 August 2024, he has been remanded in custody pending repatriation.  I am informed that he has refused to provide details of his travel documents and personal particulars, which has caused a delay in the processing of his repatriation.
On 3 April 2025, the applicant filed a notice for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence out of time by approximately three years and seven months.  The applicant appears in person in his leave application, having had legal aid refused on 16 May 2025.
The facts outlined to the judge and admitted by the applicant can be briefly stated as follows.  In the evening of 23 May 2020, he stole a box of durian from a shop at the Fruit Market at Yau Ma Tei.  Two employees of the shop chased after him.  They intercepted him, and there was a struggle.  He produced a 12 inch long knife and pointed it at the two men, who fled.  The applicant was eventually intercepted by police officers who were on patrol.  There was a struggle, and he had to be subdued.
In sentencing the applicant, the judge adopted a starting point of 21 months’ imprisonment given the seriousness of the theft offence.  After a one third discount for his guilty plea, the judge sentenced the applicant to 14 months’ imprisonment.  The judge also activated a suspended sentence of 2 weeks for shoplifting.
The applicant has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay in filing his application to appeal against his conviction and sentence.  The conviction was based on his own plea, and there is nothing to indicate that it was equivocal.  The sentence took into account his guilty plea and he was given a one third discount.  The offending was serious in that it involved the applicant, a Form 8 recognizance holder, struggling with the two employees and producing a knife to threaten them.
The applicant’s explanation for the late filing of his application was that he had suffered injuries to his feet and was incapacitated for about a year.  This is an irrelevant matter and did not provide an explanation for the delay of over 3 years in filing this application.  There is no substantial and plainly arguable ground of appeal against his conviction and sentence.
This application is devoid of merit and an attempt by the applicant to further delay his repatriation.  Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence out of time is refused.

Date of Hearing: 4 September 2025
Date of Judgment: 4 September 2025
The applicant (who was originally D1 in the court below), together with two co-‍defendants (originally D2 and D3), pleaded guilty before a magistrate to one count of robbery, contrary to section 10(1) and (2) of the Theft ‍Ordinance, Cap 210, as a result of which he was committed to the High Court for sentence.  On 9 ‍April 2025, he was sentenced in the High ‍Court by Woodcock J (“the ‍judge”) to 4 years and 5 months’ imprisonment.
By his Form XI Notice filed on 29 April 2025, the applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.  And by his two letters dated respectively 13 May 2025 and 3 August 2025, he has effectively advanced a single ground of appeal.
The facts admitted
At about 11 am on 3 March 2020, five masked and gloved men, including D2 and D3, entered a ground-floor jewellery and goldsmith shop (“the shop”) in Yuen Long, New Territories.  At the time, there were six staff members working in the shop, but no customers.  All five men had alighted from a vehicle driven by the applicant, who promptly drove off to wait for them nearby.  On entering the shop, one of the five robbers pointed a knife at staff members while others smashed the glass display units with an axe and two hammers.  A total of 7 gold rings and 71 gold bracelets valued at HK$605,091 were stolen.  The whole robbery was carried out within two minutes.
The vehicle used in the robbery was discovered later that day and found to have been stolen a week or so earlier.  After some arrests, one of the robbers, Ghale Raj, was sentenced on 3 November 2022, and two others the following day on 4 ‍November 2022, by another judge, Campbell-Moffat J, in HCCC 216/2021.  In agreeing to the summary of facts, the applicant admitted that he had acted together with the seven other persons set out in the particulars of the charge to rob the shop.
Background of the applicant and mitigation
The applicant was 53 years old at the time of sentencing.  He was single and had come to Hong Kong from Pakistan in 1990.  He had had several appearances and convictions before the courts since 2014 involving offences of possession of dangerous drugs, trafficking in dangerous drugs, theft as well as various driving offences, among them dangerous driving.  He was in part-time employment when arrested.  Counsel on his behalf emphasised that the applicant had only been recruited as the driver in the robbery.  He was not the mastermind and he did not himself enter the shop.  He had been promised a share of the stolen proceeds, but had never received any reward.
The court was invited to have regard to the sentences imposed on the other robbers involved in the same incident.
Reasons for sentence
The judge referred to the guidelines in Mo Kwong-sang v The ‍Queen concerning sentences for robberies involving weapons.  The judge noted that the robbery was committed by a group of men acting in concert; it was well-planned and obviously premeditated, and the target of the robbery was a goldsmith shop.
The judge did not distinguish between the roles of the applicant, D2 and D3, considering that they were equally culpable.  After taking into account the facts of the case and the aggravating features present, the judge adopted the same starting point of 7 years’ imprisonment which had been adopted for the other co-accused sentenced in the earlier case before Campbell-Moffat J.
Having considered the applicant’s guilty plea at the earliest opportunity and the relevant mitigating factors, the judge gave the applicant a discount of 37%, which included the conventional one-third discount for his timely plea of guilty.  The final sentence on the applicant thus became 4 years and 5 months’ imprisonment
The applicant’s grounds of appeal and submission
In his two letters dated 13 May 2025 and 3 ‍August ‍2025, the applicant has averred that ‍he was initially arrested for the present case on 9 April 2020.  He was then remanded until 28 September in the same year when the charge against him was dropped.  Subsequently, he was re-arrested in respect of the same case on 27 September 2022.  The applicant argues that the judge did not consider this previous remand period in sentencing and claims he should receive a 6-‍months’ reduction of sentence.
The respondent’s submission
Ms Lo, for the respondent, submits that having considered the facts of the case, the sentencing guidelines in Mo ‍Kwong-‍sang, the aggravating factors identified by the judge and the starting point for sentence adopted in the case of the three co-accused in HCCC 216/2021, the starting point of 7 years’ imprisonment was appropriate.
In respect of the relevant mitigating factors, Ms Lo submits that the "

J U D G M E N T
________________
On 27 February 2025, the applicant was sentenced by Barnes J (the judge) to 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment, following his plea of guilty to a single count of trafficking in dangerous drugs, namely 22.4 grammes of a crystalline solid containing 22.3 grammes of methamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as Ice) and 0.26 gramme of a mixture containing 0.22 gramme of heroin hydrochloride.
On 30 May 2025, the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal against his sentence, some two months out of time.  In his affirmation dated 29 May 2025, he stated that he decided to appeal after his family obtained legal advice, suggesting his sentence was heavy.  He alleged that both the overall sentence and the enhanced starting point of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment were excessive.
In a letter filed on 22 August 2025, the applicant elaborated on his grounds of appeal.  First, he submitted that the notional starting point of 8 years’ imprisonment for the combined drugs was manifestly excessive.  He argued that, based on the three check tests provided by his trial counsel, the starting point should not have exceeded 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.  Secondly, he contended that the judge failed to properly consider his family circumstances and remorse.  He argued that these factors warranted a greater reduction in his sentence.
At the leave hearing on 31 October 2025, the applicant appeared in person, having had legal aid refused on 3 July 2025.
The facts outlined to the judge and admitted by the applicant were as follows.  On the night of 1 October 2022, police officers on patrol in Mong Kok observed the applicant behaving suspiciously and tightly pressing his sling bag while walking along Tung Choi Street.  When the applicant was intercepted, the police found inside his sling bag a coin pouch containing resealable plastic bags with the total quantity of Ice and heroin particularised in the count.  The police also found HK$10,178 in cash in his possession.  The total street value of the drugs was estimated at HK$15,542.12.  When questioned at the scene, the applicant told the police he was unemployed and that the coin pouch contained “pork” (a term meaning “Ice”).  He was arrested and remained silent under caution.
At the time of sentencing, the applicant was 50 years old, educated to Form 3 level, and living in a public housing unit with his parents.  He had a 15-year-old daughter who lived with his ex-wife.  He had worked in casual jobs earning HK$20,000 per month, but was unemployed prior to his arrest.
Among the applicant’s 15 previous convictions, three were for possession of dangerous drugs in July 1999, May 2001 and March 2002; and two were for trafficking in dangerous drugs in June 2014 and November 2018, for which he was sentenced in the High Court to 5 years’ imprisonment and 7 years and 4 months’ imprisonment, respectively.  He committed the present offence three months after his release from prison on 30 June 2022.
In sentencing the applicant, the judge identified the starting points as 7 to 11 years’ imprisonment for the 22.3 grammes of Ice, and 2 to 5 years’ imprisonment for the 0.22 gramme of heroin, according to the applicable guideline bands.  Applying the sentencing approach in HKSAR v Islam SM Majharul and HKSAR v Herry Jane Yusuph, the judge considered the applicant’s role as a courier and adopted a starting point of 7 years and 9 months’ imprisonment for the Ice, treating it as the base drug.  This was enhanced by 3 months to reflect the presence of more than one drug, resulting in a notional starting point of 8 years’ imprisonment.  Taking into account the applicant’s previous drug convictions and that he committed a similar offence three months after his release, the judge further enhanced the starting point by 6 months to 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.  The judge noted that he was entitled to a one third reduction for his guilty plea, but rejected any further reduction for his claim that his aged parents required his assistance.  Accordingly, the judge sentenced him to 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.
The applicant complains that the starting point was excessive.  However, the judge cannot be criticised for the basis on which she determined the starting point.  Nor can it be said that the judge erred in enhancing the notional starting point to account for the involvement of multiple drugs and the applicant’s recidivism.  Except for his timely guilty plea, there were no other meaningful mitigating factors.  The applicant has no"

________________
Hon Zervos JA (giving the Judgment of the Court):
The appellant pleaded guilty to numerous fraud and related offences in three separate cases before District Court Judge Katherine Lo (the Judge) and was sentenced to a total term of 82 months and 148 days’ imprisonment (the equivalent of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment).  
The appellant is an unrepentant recidivist with a long list of convictions for offences involving fraud and dishonesty.  He committed a spree of crimes for which he was eventually charged and brought before the courts.  Two cases were consolidated and transferred to the District Court (DCCC 346 and 625/2019).  Sometime later, two other cases were transferred consecutively to the District Court (DCCC 365/2020 and DCCC 626/2020).  The three cases were heard together on plea day on 1 September 2020.  The appellant indicated to the plea day judge that he would plead guilty to all the charges in each of the three cases.  The prosecution then applied for the three cases to be heard by the same judge but at different times in an effort to address the jurisdictional limit of the District Court of 7 years’ imprisonment.  The defence opposed the application and requested that the three cases be heard by the same judge on the same occasion.  The prosecution’s application was granted.  
At the hearing of the first case, the defence renewed its application for the three cases to be heard at the same time but this was refused.  The Judge conducted three separate hearings and accordingly sentenced the appellant in respect of each one, taking into account the totality principle and the sentence that had been passed in the previous case.
The issue that arises in this appeal is whether the appellant was correctly sentenced for a total term of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment, which exceeded the seven-year jurisdictional limit of the District Court, even though he was dealt with on three separate occasions by the same judge.
Procedural history 
The appellant was first brought before the Magistracy in WKCC 2011/2018 on 5 May 2018.  He was granted court bail and he appeared in the court hearings until he failed to attend the one on 4 September 2018.  The appellant was re-arrested on 23 February 2019 and thereafter he was remanded in jail custody.  
The appellant was again brought before the Magistracy in WKCC 1023/2019 and WKCC 1260/2019 on 13 and 27 March 2019 respectively. 
On 6 May 2019, on an application by the prosecution, WKCC 2011/2018 was transferred to the District Court with the new case number DCCC 346/2019. 
In a letter dated 17 July 2019, the appellant requested that the two cases, WKCC 1023/2019 and WKCC 1260/2019, be consolidated and transferred to the District Court, and that they be further consolidated with DCCC 346/2019, “on the condition that he indicated his guilty pleas to all the charges in open court”.  The prosecution acceded to this request and applied for the consolidation of the two cases and the transfer of the consolidated case to the District Court on 14 August 2019.  The consolidated case of WKCC 1023/2019 and WKCC 1260/2019 was assigned the case number DCCC 625/2019.  DCCC 346/2019 and DCCC 625/2019 were then consolidated in the District Court on 17 September 2019.  However, DCCC 346 and 625/2019 (consolidated) was subject to a series of adjournments because of ongoing investigations against the appellant for other offences.  
On 4 June 2020, the appellant was brought before the Magistracy in TMCC 879/2020.  The prosecution applied for the transfer of this case to the District Court, which became DCCC 365/2020. 
On 17 June 2020, the appellant next appeared in the Magistracy in KCCC 1448/2020.  Counsel representing the appellant informed the prosecution that “the appellant intended to plead guilty to all the charges faced by him and wished to have all three cases, namely DCCC 346 and 625/2019 (consolidated), DCCC 365/2020 and KCCC 1448/2020, heard before the same judge in the District Court.  The prosecution agreed to and applied for the transfer of KCCC 1448/2020 to the District Court on 13 August 2020”, which became DCCC 626/2020. 
As noted, the three cases were heard together on plea day in the District Court on 1 September 2020.  The appellant through his counsel indicated he would plead guilty to the charges in the three cases.  An application was made by the prosecution that the three cases be heard by the same judge but at different times.  The defe"
